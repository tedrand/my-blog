**tl,dr:** I, like a majority of webmasters, use Google Analytics to track traffic to the website. However, the users' specific \"personally identifiable information\" (PII) is anonymized.

I, Ted Rand (the \"sole proprietor\") respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

This policy describes the types of information I may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website TedRand.com (the \"Website\") and my practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

Please read this policy carefully to understand the policies and practices regarding your information and how it is treated. If you do not agree with the policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Website. By accessing this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to the Privacy Policy). Your continued use of this Website after I make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

**Information I Collect About You and How I Collect It**

If you visit the Website to browse, read, or download information, your browser automatically sends information to the Website's Google Analytics platform, such as the:

- Internet domain through which you access the Internet (e.g., yourServiceProvider.com if you use a commercial Internet Service Provider (\"ISP\"), or yourSchool.edu if you use an internet account from your school);

- Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address of the computer you are using;

- type of browser software and operating system you are using;

- date and time you access the Website; and

- the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to the Website.

I will use this information as aggregate data to help me maintain this site, e.g., to determine the number of visitors to different sections of the Website, to ensure the Website is working properly, and to help me make the Website more accessible and useful. I will not use this information to identify individuals, except for site security or law enforcement purposes. I will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit the Website, unless you choose to provide such information.

I keep information based on Google Analytics' retention policy, which I have set to 26 months. Please note that electronic communication, particularly email, is not necessarily secure against interception. Please do not send sensitive date (e.g., Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers) by email or web form.

## Cookies

I may use cookies in order to customize the Website for return visitors. These cookies are not required for site functionality. Additionally, third-party widgets such as YouTube or Flickr may install cookies depending on their configuration. Your are not required to accept any cookies to use this site.

## Google Analytics

I use a tool called \"Google Analytics\" to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming ot this site. I use the information from Google Analytics only to improve this Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information. I do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use (as amended for government websites) and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent Googel Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.

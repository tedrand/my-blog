Thanks for stopping by to check out my website. I'm a law student at UNH Franklin Pierce School of Law in Concord, New Hampshire. I am currently studying to practice patent law. I made this site because I love writing code and because I wanted to have a place to articulate the way I study the law.

After a brief stint at a small start-up making graphics software for sports broadcasting, I went to an AdTech company called Sovrn in Boulder, Colorado. Sovrn was an amazing company, and I worked closely with a cool group of people. I made my first meaningful contribution to an open-source library and learned how to release production code. But even more importantly, I developed some great working relationships with peers and mentors that have been invaluable to my personal growth.

While I loved working with code and solving technical problems, I realized things about my strengths at Sovrn that led me to pursue a career in law. I had a commendable ability to communicate with clients and to see issues from their perspective.

Last summer I worked for Morgan, Lewis & Bockius's Silicon Valley office as a Summer Associate. My role was mainly forcused on patent prosecution and patent litigation matters. While I had planned to work with the team in person in Palo Alto, COVID-19 changed my plans, and I spent the summer working remotely from my "virtual office" in Concord, New Hampshire.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling and hiking with my wonderful girlfriend, Molly Jensen. I also like reading about new developments in the law, and of course, writing JavaScript.

<b>Seizure.</b> If police have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot (i.e., that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed by the suspect), police may "stop" the person to ask questions.

<b>Search.</b> If police have a reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous, police may also "frisk" the person for weapons (i.e., give a quick pat-down of the person's outer clothing).

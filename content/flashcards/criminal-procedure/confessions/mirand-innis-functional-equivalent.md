question: "What is the rule from Rhode Island v. Innis about functional equivalents of interrogation?"
---

While the Court declined to limit "interrogation" to express questioning, holding that what would reasonably considered as the functional equivalent of express questioning would also amount to interrogation.

- The "functional equivalent" of express question can be defined as "any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect." <i>Innis</i>, 446 U.S. at 301.

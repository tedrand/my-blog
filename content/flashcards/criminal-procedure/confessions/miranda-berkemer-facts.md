type: "flashcard"
question: "What are the facts in Berkemer v. McCarty?"
---

McCarty's vehicle was weaving back and forth on the Interstate Highway. He gets stopped for a traffic offense and is falling down drunk. He is immediately asked: "How much to drink?" To which he said: "Two beers and several joints." He is arrested and transported to jail, where questioning is resumed at the station and he never received Miranda warrnings.

<b>Issues:</b>

1. Does Miranda apply to a misdemeanor traffic offense?
2. Is a roadside questioning following a motor vehicle stop a custodial interrogation under Miranda?

<b>Holding</b>

1. Yes. <i>Miranda</i> does not hinge on the severity of crime.
2. No. Persons temporarily detained for traffic stops are not in custody.

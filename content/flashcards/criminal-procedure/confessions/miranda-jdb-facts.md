J.D.B. was a 13-year-old special education student. Police question J.D.B. about a string of neighborhood burglaries after learning that he was in possession of a digital camera that had been reported stolen. J.D.B. was escorted to a school conference room and investigated him where he eventually confessed. His parents were not contacted and was not read <i>Miranda</i> warnings.

<b>Issue:</b> Whether courts should consider the age of a juvenile suspect in deciding whether he or she is in custody for <i>Miranda</i> purposes.

<b>Holding:</b> Yes. "A child's age is an objective fact that would affect how a reasonable person in the suspect's position would perceive his freedom to terminat questioning and leave."

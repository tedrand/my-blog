<i>Miranda</i> required the warnings and other protective measures whenever there is "<i>questioning</i> initated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way." 384 U.S. at 443 (emphasis added).
- "the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation bulurs the line between voluntary and involuntary statements, and thus heightens the risk that an individual will not be 'accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment . . . not to be compelled to incriminate himself.'" <i>Dickerson v. United States</i>, 530 U.S. 428 (2000) (quoting <i>Miranda v. Arizona</i>, 384 U.S. 436, 439 (1966)).

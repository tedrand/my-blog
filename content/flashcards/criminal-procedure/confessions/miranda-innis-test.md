description: "Flashcard question about the Miranda Requirements."

The Court held that the focus of the test is perception of the suspect rather than the intent of the police.

- "Any knowledge the police may have had concerning the unusual susceptibility of a defendant to a particular form of persuasion might be an important factor in determining whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect." 446 U.S. at 302 n.8.

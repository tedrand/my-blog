The defendant is arrested, and the sergeant and captain arrive on the seen. The defendant says that he wants to speak with a lawyer. During transport, police have a discussion about the missing shotgun, and the potential danger it would be to a handicapped child, specifically a little girl. The Defendant interrupts and shows the officers the gun's location.

<b>Issue:</b> Whether the police discussion about the missing gun is a form of questioning similar enough to questioning to invoke <i>Miranda</i>.

<b>Holding:</b> No. The Court held that Miranda safeguards come into play "whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent."

- The defendant was not interrogated â€“ it was just a conversation he voluntarily interrupted.

A lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case be established beyond a reasonable doubt, even if there is not a factual or legal basis for challenging the element. MRPC 3.1.

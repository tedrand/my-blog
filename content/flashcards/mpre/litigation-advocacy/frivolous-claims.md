A lawyer is prohibited from bringing or defending a proceeding, or asserting or opposing an issue in a proceeding unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous. A good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law is not frivolous. MRPC 3.1.

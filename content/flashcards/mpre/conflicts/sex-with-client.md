- The rule does not permit the client to waive the conflict through informed consent.
- The conflict is <i>personal</i> to the lawyer and is not imputed to others in the lawyer's firm. MRPC 1.8(k).
- If the client is an organization, the lawyer is prohibited from having a sexual relationship with a constituent of the organization who supervises, directs, or regularly consults with the lawyer with regard to the organization's legal matters. MRPC 1.8, cmt. 19.

In general, a lawyer must not commingle a client's funds that are in the lawyer's possession in connection with a representation with the lawyer's own funds. A client's funds must be kept in a separate client trust account maintained int the state where the lawyer's office is situated, unless the client consents to another location. MRPC 1.15(a).

A lawyer may reveal confidential information concerning the lawyer reasonably believes it necessary to comply with a court order. MRPC 1.6(b)(6). Unless the client provides informed consent to do otherwise, the lawyer should assert on behalf of the client all non-frivolous claims that the order is not authorized by other law or that the information sought is protected against disclosure by attorney-client privilege or other applicable law. MRPC 1.6, cmt. 13.

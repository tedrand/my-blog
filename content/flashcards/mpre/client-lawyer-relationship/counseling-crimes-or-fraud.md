A lawyer is prohibited from counseling or assisting the client in conduct the lawyer knows to be criminal or fraudulent. If the lawyer does advise or assist with a crime or fraud, the lawyer is subject to discipline as well as civil liability.

- A lawyer is permitted to discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning, or application of the law. MRPC 1.2(d).
- If the client's course of action has already begun and is continuing, the lawyer is required to avoid assisting the client and must withdraw from the representation. MRPC 1.2, cmt. 10; 1.16(a).

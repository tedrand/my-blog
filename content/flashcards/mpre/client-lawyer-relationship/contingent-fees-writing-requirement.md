question: "What is the writing requirement for contingent fees?"

A contingent fee arrangement must be in writing, and must include:

<p class="_f-indent">
i) Signature of the client;<br />
ii) Calculation methodology of the fee; and <br />
iii) Details of the calculation for deductions and expenses, including whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingency fee is calculated.
</p>

The agreement must clearly set out any expenses for which the client will be held liable even though the client is not the prevailing party. At the conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer must provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination. MRPC 1.5(c).

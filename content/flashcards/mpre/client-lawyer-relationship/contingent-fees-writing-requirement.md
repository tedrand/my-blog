A contingent fee arrangement must be in writing, and must include:

i) Signature of the client;

ii) Calculation methodology of the fee; and

iii) Details of the calculation for deductions and expenses, including whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingency fee is calculated.

The agreement must clearly set out any expenses for which the client will be held liable even though the client is not the prevailing party. At the conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer must provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.

A judge is not permitted to commend or criticize jurors for their verdict other than in a court order or opinion in a proceeding. CJC Rule 2.8(C). Commending or criticizing jurors for a verdict may imply a judicial expectation in future cases and may impair a jurorâ€™s ability to be fair and impartial in a subsequent case. CJC Rule 2.8, cmt. 2. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, a judge may meet with jurors who choose to remain after trial, but should be careful not to discuss the merits of the case. CJC Rule 2.8, cmt. 3.

A judge is permitted to provide a reference or recommendation for an individual based upon the judge's personal knowledge. While a judge must not use judicial letterhead to gain an advantage in conducting his personal business, the judge may use official letterhead for a reference for someone else if the judge indicates that the reference is personal and if there is no likelihood that the use of the letterhead would reasonably perceived as an attempt to use the judge's official position to exert pressure. CJC Rule 1.3, cmt. 4.

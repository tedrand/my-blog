There are many kinds of open source licenses, but what do they all really mean to the typical software developer. Today we look at several of the most popular licenses and how they affect the code that you right.

## The Open Source License

A "license" is permission granted by a qualified authority permitting a licensee to do something that would otherwise be prohibited. An open source license is a grant of qualified authority for developers and other parties to utilize a piece of software.

The tricky thing to understand about an open source license is that it is simultaneously a grant of rights and a restriction of rights. One popular article on the topic says that "[t]he license is what turns code into an open source component. Without an open source license, the software component is unusable by others, even if it has been publicly posted on Github."[^1] But this statement is only absolutely true if the original author has protectable rights to the software in the form of a copyright, patent, or other intellectual property right. Further, any such right is not protected by good faith. As many lawyers have learned the hard way, there is no "bad faith" in breaking a contract. Likewise, there is no extra-statutory culpability in breaching an intellectual property right. However, such a breach of right can be statutorily subject to treble damages (3x actual monetary damages).

So, what does this all mean for the average developer? To be honest, the answer is almost entirely dependent on the situation. Sadly, like most legal questions, the answer is necessarily "it depends." And what does it depend on? Mostly money. The value of a particular use of software, and the ability of a company to extract damages, as well as the potential liability, can be a critical factor in analyzing the importance of a license. So in evaluating the issue, it is always a good idea to ask, "how much could someone gain or lose in a transaction to enforce rights under the license."

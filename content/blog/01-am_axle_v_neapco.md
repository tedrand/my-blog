On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Federal Circuit (CAFC) denied plaintiff-appellant American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc.'s (AAM's) motion to stay issuance of the mandate in light of a petition for Supreme Court review.

In evaluating AAM's case, the CAFC first looked to the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41, which provides that a motion for stay of the mandate "must show that the petition would present a substantial question and that there is good cause for a stay." The court noted that it previously applied the rule to deny a stay in <i>Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc.</i>.[^1] The requirements for a showing good cause for a stay are that a "(1) a reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to reverse the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay." In <i>Teva</i>, the CAFC denied the stay based on prong (3), finding "the extraordinary relief that Teva \[sought was] unwarranted," since they would be able to recover damages for past infringement if they were to win at the Supreme Court.

The Federal Circuit denied American Axle's (AAM's) argument that good cause for a stay existed because AAM "intend\[ed] to petition for certiorari with regard to the entirety" of \[the CAFC's] judgment" and that "\[s]ignificant burdens and expenses would accrue." Looking to numerous precedent, the CAFC reiterated that "\[m]ere litigation expense, even substantial and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irreparable injury."

### Judge Moore's Concurrence

Writing in concurrence, Judge Moore elaborated on the holding by first noting that AAM had failed on the third prong only, and that the first two had been satisfied. Interestingly, Judge Moore compared the CAFC's lack of uniformity in applying 35 U.S.C. Section 101 to a circuit split. Moore noted that in the CAFC's struggle to find consistency in applying &sect; 101, they had "slowly creat\[ed] a panel-dependent body of law and \[were] destroying the ability of the American business to invest with predictability." Every judge on the CAFC, as well as commentators, and amici are requesting Supreme Court clarification.

In part II of the concurrence, Moore explained that the claims at issue in the case were not directed to a business method, or financial method like in <i>Alice</i> or <i>Bilski</i>, but instead were related to a process for manufacturing a car. Describing the CAFC's decision in <i>American Axle</i> as a "patent killing judicial exception of \[the CAFC's] own creation," Moore's concurrence exuded a concern that upholding the decision would threaten to swallow patent law in the &sect;101 exception.

Finally, Judge Moore agreed with the CAFC as to the third prong despite the fact that AAM would face "significant expense and potentially duplicative process" in litigating the new arguments in district court while waiting for the Supreme Court's decision to review the case.

### Conclusion

While the ball is now in the Supreme Court's hands as to whether to take up the &sect;101 question that the CAFC has tee'd up for the Court, the case will be reopened in the district court, and new discovery will surely ensue. Readers are encouraged to review the original decision by the CAFC for more context on this interesting and potentially landmark &sect;101 battle.

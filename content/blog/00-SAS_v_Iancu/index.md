### Introduction

In <i>SAS Inst. v. Iancu</i>, the Supreme Court addressed the issue of partial institutions by the PTAB.[^1] The Court held that, based on the statute's plain language, the Office must address all claims if it chooses to institute a challenge as to any claim.

The Court began by discussing the statutory changes to validity challenges at the Patent Office, noting that in 2011, "Congress repealed inter partes reexamination and replaced it with inter partes review."[^2]

The case began when SAS challenged ComplementSoft's software patent by seeking inter partes review, alleging that all 16 of the claims were unpatentable. The Director of the Office (Andre Iancu) instituted review on claims 1 and 3-10 and denied review of the other challenged claims. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the "Board") ended up finding all of the claims unpatentable except for claim 4. SAS appealed the decision to the Federal Circuit, arguing that 35 U.S.C. &sect;318(a)[^3] required the Board to review every challenged claim. Despite "vigorous" dissent by Judge Newman, the Board rejected this argument.

### Discussion

The Court focused on the plain meaning of the statute, noting that the proclamation that the Board "<i>shall issue</i> a final written decision with respect to the patentability of <i>any patent challenged by the petitioner</i>" left no room for discretion on the part of the Office to pick and choose which claims to review.[^4] The Court compared the new statutory language to that of the former proceedings, which allowed the petitioner to investigate claims "[o]n his oewn initiative, and at any time," noting Congress's affirmative decision to depart from the former statutory regime.

The Court rebutted the Director's challenge that the statute invested him with discretion "whether" to institute the review under &sect;314(b). Instead, holding that "whether" in that section does not mean "whether, and to what extent." The Court also rejected the Director's argument that partial institution allowed for more efficient proceedings by noting that partial institution actually leads to inefficiency in that it "requires the parties to litigate in two places instead of one--the Board for claims the Director chooses to entertain and the federal court for claims he refused."[^5]

After dismissing the Director's argument for <i>Chevron</i> deference, the Court addressed his final challenge under &sect;314(d) that "determination by the Director whether to institute an inter partes review under this section shall be final and nonappealable." The Director cited the Court's decision in <i>Cuozzo</i>, which prevented courts from finding error in the Director's institution of certain patent claims. The Court found this argument to overread their own precedent, and that even <i>Cuozzo</i> did not "enable the agency to act outside its statutory limit."[^6]

### Ginsburg's Dissent

The late Justice Ginsburg penned a dissent in the case, questioning why the statute would be read in way that would "preclude the Board's more rational way to weed out insubstantial challenges."[^7]

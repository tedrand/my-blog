(“AAM”) filed a motion to stay issuance of the mandate\n pending the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari in the\n Supreme Court. Defendants-appellees opposed the motion.\n                               I\n     Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41 provides that a\n motion for stay of the mandate “must show that the peti-\n tion would present a substantial question and that there is\n good cause for a stay.” Fed. R. App. P. 41(d)(1). The Advi-\n sory Committee Notes state that “[t]he Supreme Court has\n established conditions that must be met before it will stay\n a mandate.” Fed. R. App. P. 41, advisory committee’s note\n to 1994 amendment (citing Robert L. Stern et al., Supreme\n Court Practice § 17.19 (6th ed. 1986)). In this respect, the\n Advisory Committee Notes refer to the standard estab-\n lished by the in-chambers opinions of the individual jus-\n tices. See Stern et al., supra, § 17.19. The Supreme Court\n itself has approved this standard in Hollingsworth v. Perry,\n 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010).\n     This standard requires that the applicant show “(1) a\n reasonable probability that four Justices will consider the\n issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari; (2) a fair\n prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to reverse\n the judgment below; and (3) a likelihood that irreparable\n harm will result from the denial of a stay. In close cases\n the Circuit Justice or the Court will balance the equities\n and weigh the relative harms to the applicant and to the\n respondent.” Id.\n     Chief Justice Roberts, acting as the Circuit Justice for\n this court, specifically applied that standard in a patent\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139     Page: 3    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS           3\n LLC\n\n\n case, denying a stay solely for lack of irreparable injury.\n Teva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 572 U.S. 1301,\n 1301–02 (2014) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers). After we held\n certain of Teva’s patent claims invalid, Teva sought a stay\n in order to prevent market entry by the generic pharma-\n ceutical company respondents. The Chief Justice noted\n that the first two requirements for a stay were met, be-\n cause the Supreme Court had already granted certiorari\n and Teva had “shown a fair prospect of success on the mer-\n its.” Id. at 1301. But he denied a stay because a likelihood\n of irreparable injury was not shown, explaining that\n “[r]espondents acknowledge[d] that, should Teva prevail\n . . . and its patent be held valid, Teva [would] be able to\n recover damages from respondents for past patent infringe-\n ment” and therefore “the extraordinary relief that Teva\n [sought was] unwarranted.” Id. at 1301–02.\n     As a matter of Federal Circuit law, we interpret the\n Rule as requiring application of the standard articulated\n by the Supreme Court in Hollingsworth and the Justices’\n in-chambers opinions. See Biodex Corp. v. Loredan Bio-\n medical, Inc., 946 F.2d 850, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Federal\n Circuit law, not regional circuit law, governs such matters).\n                              II\n     In this case, AAM has not made the required showing\n of a likelihood of irreparable injury absent a stay. With\n respect to claim 22 and related claims, the decision of this\n court requires no further action by the district court since\n the claims have been held to be unpatentable. AAM argues\n that “[i]f the Supreme Court grants review and decides that\n the asserted claims of [AAM’s patent] are patent eligible\n under § 101, this Court will have to recall its mandate to\n conform its disposition with such a decision.” Mot. 14, ECF\n No. 136. This action, common to every case in which the\n Supreme Court does not affirm, is not irreparable harm.\n     With respect to claim 1 and related claims, the decision\n of this court remands to the district court for further\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139      Page: 4    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4     AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v.

AAM argues that there is “good cause for a\n stay” because it “intends to petition for certiorari with re-\n gard to the entirety” of our judgment and argues that “[s]ig-\n nificant burdens and expenses would accrue” should the\n mandate issue because “the parties and district court\n would continue to litigate issues related to claim 1.” Id. at\n 12–13. Continued litigation with respect to claim 1 cannot\n be irreparable injury. “Mere litigation expense, even sub-\n stantial and unrecoupable cost, does not constitute irrepa-\n rable injury.” Renegotiation Bd. v. Bannercraft Clothing\n Co., 415 U.S. 1, 24 (1974); see also Commonwealth Oil Re-\n fin. Co. v. Lummus Co., 82 S. Ct. 348, 349 (1961) (Harlan,\n J., in chambers) (denying motion for stay of the mandate\n where the only possible harm from denial of the stay was\n that it could “set in motion the machinery for arbitration\n and . . . other matters affecting the possible future conduct\n of the arbitration”); Nara v. Frank, 494 F.3d 1132, 1133 (3d\n Cir. 2007) (need to “prepar[e] to commence trial within 120\n days while simultaneously filing a petition for certiorari”\n was not irreparable injury under Rule 41); United States v.\n Microsoft Corp., No. 00-5212, 2001 WL 931170, at *1 (D.C.\n Cir. Aug. 17, 2001) (denying motion to stay mandate under\n Rule 41 because movant “failed to demonstrate any sub-\n stantial harm that would result from the reactivation of\n proceedings in the district court during the limited pen-\n dency of the certiorari petition.”).\n      AAM has cited no authority suggesting that the pro-\n spect of further district court proceedings while the case is\n on review could constitute irreparable injury. AAM points\n to the Practice Note to this court’s Rule 41, which reminds\n litigants that their right to seek certiorari is unaffected by\n the issuance of the mandate and, “[c]onsequently, a motion\n to stay the mandate should advance reasons for the stay\n beyond the mere intention to apply for certiorari, e.g., to\n forestall action in the trial court or agency that would ne-\n cessitate a remedial order of the Supreme Court if the writ\n of certiorari were granted.” Fed. Cir. R. 41 practice note.\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139     Page: 5   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS            5\n LLC\n\n\n But that Practice Note would not displace the governing\n stay standard if they conflicted. Even by its own terms,\n moreover, the Practice Note’s language does not support a\n conclusion that the trial court proceedings that might occur\n regarding claim 1 and related claims would support a stay.\n Under the standard applied by the Supreme Court, this is\n not a situation in which the Court would issue a “remedial\n order” staying our mandate if certiorari were granted since\n the only claimed irreparable injury is litigation cost.\n     We conclude that the irreparable injury requirement is\n not satisfied here. On this ground alone a stay is not war-\n ranted, quite apart from the merit or lack of merit of the\n petition for certiorari.\n     Accordingly,\n     IT IS ORDERED THAT:\n     The motion to stay the mandate pending the filing of a\n petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court is de-\n nied.\n                                 FOR THE COURT\n\n   October 23, 2020               /s/ Peter R.

I write separately to elaborate on how\n those prongs apply here. While American Axle has\n established a reasonable probability that certiorari will be\n granted and a fair prospect that the majority of the Court\n will reverse, it fails to establish irreparable harm and thus\n a stay is not warranted.\n                               I\n     The Supreme Court often grants certiorari to resolve\n circuit splits that render the state of the law inconsistent\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139      Page: 7     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 2   AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS\n                                                            LLC\n\n\n and chaotic. See, e.g., Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S.\n 344, 347 (1991) (“A principal purpose for which we use our\n certiorari jurisdiction . . . is to resolve conflicts among the\n United States courts of appeals and state courts concerning\n the meaning of provisions of federal law.”); see also Rogers\n v. Grewal, 140 S. Ct. 1865, 1875 (2020) (Thomas, J.,\n dissenting from the denial of certiorari) (“This case gives\n us an opportunity to provide lower courts with much-\n needed guidance, ensure adherence to our precedents, and\n resolve a Circuit split.          Each of these reasons is\n independently sufficient to grant certiorari.”). What we\n have here is worse than a circuit split—it is a court bitterly\n divided.\n     As the nation’s lone patent court, we are at a loss as to\n how to uniformly apply § 101. All twelve active judges of\n this court urged the Supreme Court to grant certiorari in\n Athena to provide us with guidance regarding whether\n diagnostic claims are eligible for patent protection. There\n is very little about which all twelve of us are unanimous,\n especially when it comes to § 101. We were unanimous in\n our unprecedented plea for guidance.           But, as we\n acknowledged in our decisions in Athena, that holding was\n at heart a reticent application of Mayo to similar claims.\n      The current case is the progeny of neither Alice nor\n Mayo. It is our own dramatic expansion of a judicial\n exception to § 101. Section 101 is clear: “[w]hoever invents\n or discovers any new and useful process,” like the claims\n here, “may obtain a patent.” Yet, we have struggled to\n consistently apply the judicially created exceptions to this\n broad statutory grant of eligibility, slowly creating a panel-\n dependent body of law and destroying the ability of\n American businesses to invest with predictability. See\n Smart Sys. Innovations, LLC v. Chicago Transit Auth., 873\n F.3d 1364, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (Linn, J., dissenting-in-\n part and concurring-in-part) (characterizing § 101 doctrine\n as “indeterminate and often lead[ing] to arbitrary results”).\n Our confusion has driven commentators, amici, and every\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139     Page: 8    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS           3\n LLC\n\n judge on this court to request Supreme Court clarification.\n See Athena Diagnostics, Inc. v. Mayo Collaborative Servs.,\n LLC, 927 F.3d 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2019). If a circuit split\n warrants certiorari, such an irreconcilable split in the\n nation’s only patent court does likewise.\n      This case is a model of our divide. To be sure, natural\n laws are “basic tools of scientific and technological work,”\n “free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.” Mayo\n Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66,\n 70–71 (2012). Before this case, we applied this exception\n narrowly, because “all inventions at some level embody,\n use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural\n phenomena, or abstract ideas,” so “too broad an\n interpretation of this exclusionary principle could\n eviscerate patent law.” Id. at 71. In a divided panel here,\n we struggled to marry these concepts into an administrable\n distinction between eligible and ineligible claims. The\n majority concluded as a matter of law that claims to a\n manufacturing process are not eligible for patent\n protection because they are directed to a law of nature even\n though no law of nature appears in the claims, the patent,\n or the prosecution history. Under the majority’s new\n “Nothing More” test, claims are ineligible when they\n merely make use of a natural law. We have strayed too far\n from the text of the statute. I dissented, proposing that we\n follow the narrow test announced in Alice and that we\n refrain from usurping the district court’s factfinding role.\n Equally divided in a 6-6 vote, the full court denied\n rehearing en banc and, in doing so, detailed its further\n divided views. Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings\n LLC, 966 F.3d 1347, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (prompting two\n opinions concurring in the denial and three opinions\n dissenting from the denial). I believe American Axle has\n established that there is a reasonable probability certiorari\n will be granted.\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139      Page: 9     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4   AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS\n                                                            LLC\n\n\n                               II\n      The claims here are not directed to a business method,\n internet or financial method, the likes of which the Court\n dealt with in Alice or Bilski. Nor does this case map onto\n the Court’s holding in Mayo regarding the patent eligibility\n of diagnostic inventions, as did our decisions in Ariosa and\n Athena. Instead, our decision in American Axle is a patent\n killing judicial exception of our own creation. The claims\n here are directed to a process for manufacturing car\n parts—the type of process which has been eligible since the\n invention of the car itself. They do not preempt the use of\n a natural law, a building block of science, which should be\n freely available to all. To nonetheless hold these claims\n ineligible, the majority broadens the judicial exceptions in\n a way that threatens to swallow the whole of the statute.\n See Am. Axle & Mfg., Inc. v. Neapco Holdings LLC, 967\n F.3d 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2020), reh’g denied, 966 F.3d 1347,\n 1365 (Stoll, J., dissenting) (“I grow more concerned with\n each passing decision that we are, piece by piece, allowing\n the judicial exception to patent eligibility to ‘swallow all of\n patent law.’”) (quoting Alice Corp. Pty. v. CLS Bank Int’l,\n 573 U.S. 208, 217 (2014) and citing Mayo, 566 U.S. at 70–\n 73). Such a rejection of the plain language of the patent\n statute in favor of a vast and amorphous judicial exception\n in which we Federal Circuit judges get to decide de novo\n not just the legal principles, but the application of the\n science itself, cannot stand. American Axle has established\n a fair probability that the Supreme Court will reverse.\n     The Supreme Court has often corrected this court when\n we have defied precedent or strayed from our mandate by\n claiming de novo dominion over factual issues. See, e.g.,\n Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1923, 1931–\n 34 (2016); Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S.\n 318, 324–27 (2015); KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc., 550 U.S.\n 398, 407 (2007). We repeat this mistake again. We hold as\n a matter of law that the claimed result (a reduction in two\n types of vibration in a drive shaft) was achieved by nothing\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139       Page: 10   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n  AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS           5\n  LLC\n\n  more than a natural law that appeared nowhere in the\n  claims, patent or prosecution history. We approach as a\n  question of law whether the vibrations in the drive shaft\n  were reduced by application of Hooke’s Law and nothing\n  more. And in doing so, we reject the undisputed testimony\n  of both experts. This is simply not our role as appellate\n  judges. American Axle has established a fair prospect that\n  the Supreme Court will reverse our usurpation of the\n  district court’s fact-finding role and our decision to expand\n  the natural law exception to cover an automotive\n  manufacturing process in direct contravention of the plain\n  statutory language.\n                               III\n      Our remand to the district court of claim 1 and its\n  dependent claims will surely cause redundant, expensive\n  process. We unanimously held that claim 1 and its\n  dependent claims are not directed to a natural law. But as\n  the majority explained: “On appeal, Neapco relied on both\n  the natural law and abstract idea categories of ineligibility\n  in defending the district court’s decision. But the abstract\n  idea basis was not adequately presented and litigated in\n  the district court.” Am. Axle, 967 F.3d at 1300–01. Still,\n  the majority ordered the district court to consider the\n  abstract idea arguments on remand. Whether a claim is\n  directed to Hooke’s Law is a different question than\n  whether a claim is directed to an abstract idea. I dissented\n  from our remand which requires the district court to\n  consider a defense which we concluded was not adequately\n  presented and litigated. Whether to allow such a new\n  defense ought to be within the sound discretion of the\n  district court, but the majority’s remand dictates\n  otherwise. The court and parties will now be forced to\n  undertake significant, expensive and burdensome process\n  addressing this new defense.\n      Due process demands that American Axle be given the\n  “opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139      Page: 11     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n  6   AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v. NEAPCO HOLDINGS\n                                                            LLC\n\n\n  meaningful manner” regarding Neapco’s new arguments.\n  Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976) (internal\n  quotation marks omitted). Therefore, discovery must be\n  reopened, new expert reports permitted, and new summary\n  judgment briefing allowed. And since the defendant gets\n  to challenge these patent claims on an entirely different\n  ground (abstract idea versus natural law), American Axle\n  as the patentee is free to make whatever arguments it\n  chooses in defense—such as arguments regarding the\n  factual underpinnings of the second part of the Alice-Mayo\n  test and the level of detailed structure present in the\n  dependent claims. The majority’s forced do-over works\n  both ways. And depending on the actions of the Supreme\n  Court, there could be significant wasteful, duplicative or\n  parallel process, including on American Axle’s dependent\n  claims, which we refused to separately address. Or\n  American Axle may choose to seek certiorari on the\n  propriety of our remand as to claim 1, and the Supreme\n  Court may determine that our remand instructions were\n  improper.\n      Although American Axle faces significant expense and\n  potentially duplicative process, this is not irreparable\n  harm. Thus, I join the majority’s adoption of the three-\n  prong test and its decision that we cannot stay the mandate\n  in this case under these circumstances. It bears noting,\n  however, that although we have not stayed our mandate,\n  the district court retains “the power to stay proceedings” as\n  to claim 1 and the dependent claims, which “is incidental\n  to the power inherent in every court to control the\n  disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time\n  and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis\n  v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936) (reviewing decision\n  to stay for an abuse of discretion).\n\f",

Each of these reasons is\n independently sufficient to grant certiorari.”). What we\n have here is worse than a circuit split—it is a court bitterly\n divided.\n     As the nation’s lone patent court, we are at a loss as to\n how to uniformly apply § 101. All twelve active judges of\n this court urged the Supreme Court to grant certiorari in\n Athena to provide us with guidance regarding whether\n diagnostic claims are eligible for patent protection. There\n is very little about which all twelve of us are unanimous,\n especially when it comes to § 101. We were unanimous in\n our unprecedented plea for guidance.           But, as we\n acknowledged in our decisions in Athena, that holding was\n at heart a reticent application of Mayo to similar claims.\n      The current case is the progeny of neither Alice nor\n Mayo. It is our own dramatic expansion of a judicial\n exception to § 101. Section 101 is clear: “[w]hoever invents\n or discovers any new and useful process,” like the claims\n here, “may obtain a patent.” Yet, we have struggled to\n consistently apply the judicially created exceptions to this\n broad statutory grant of eligibility, slowly creating a panel-\n dependent body of law and destroying the ability of\n American businesses to invest with predictability.

Under the majority’s new\n “Nothing More” test, claims are ineligible when they\n merely make use of a natural law. We have strayed too far\n from the text of the statute. I dissented, proposing that we\n follow the narrow test announced in Alice and that we\n refrain from usurping the district court’s factfinding role.\n Equally divided in a 6-6 vote, the full court denied\n rehearing en banc and, in doing so, detailed its further\n divided views.

They do not preempt the use of\n a natural law, a building block of science, which should be\n freely available to all.

We approach as a\n  question of law whether the vibrations in the drive shaft\n  were reduced by application of Hooke’s Law and nothing\n  more. And in doing so, we reject the undisputed testimony\n  of both experts. This is simply not our role as appellate\n  judges.

Still,\n  the majority ordered the district court to consider the\n  abstract idea arguments on remand. Whether a claim is\n  directed to Hooke’s Law is a different question than\n  whether a claim is directed to an abstract idea. I dissented\n  from our remand which requires the district court to\n  consider a defense which we concluded was not adequately\n  presented and litigated. Whether to allow such a new\n  defense ought to be within the sound discretion of the\n  district court, but the majority’s remand dictates\n  otherwise. The court and parties will now be forced to\n  undertake significant, expensive and burdensome process\n  addressing this new defense.\n      Due process demands that American Axle be given the\n  “opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a\n\fCase: 18-1763    Document: 139      Page: 11     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n  6   AMERICAN AXLE & MANUFACTURING v.

Therefore, discovery must be\n  reopened, new expert reports permitted, and new summary\n  judgment briefing allowed. And since the defendant gets\n  to challenge these patent claims on an entirely different\n  ground (abstract idea versus natural law), American Axle\n  as the patentee is free to make whatever arguments it\n  chooses in defense—such as arguments regarding the\n  factual underpinnings of the second part of the Alice-Mayo\n  test and the level of detailed structure present in the\n  dependent claims. The majority’s forced do-over works\n  both ways. And depending on the actions of the Supreme\n  Court, there could be significant wasteful, duplicative or\n  parallel process, including on American Axle’s dependent\n  claims, which we refused to separately address. Or\n  American Axle may choose to seek certiorari on the\n  propriety of our remand as to claim 1, and the Supreme\n  Court may determine that our remand instructions were\n  improper.\n      Although American Axle faces significant expense and\n  potentially duplicative process, this is not irreparable\n  harm. Thus, I join the majority’s adoption of the three-\n  prong test and its decision that we cannot stay the mandate\n  in this case under these circumstances. It bears noting,\n  however, that although we have not stayed our mandate,\n  the district court retains “the power to stay proceedings” as\n  to claim 1 and the dependent claims, which “is incidental\n  to the power inherent in every court to control the\n  disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time\n  and effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis\n  v.

Lyon v. Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., 224\n F.2d 530, 536 (2d Cir. 1955). 1 Today, he would likely save\n\n\n     1    Essentially, the invention requirement instructed\n courts to invalidate patents that did not involve a true\n measure of invention, with little explanation of what that\n concept meant. See McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U.S. 419,\n 427 (1891) (“In a given case we may be able to say that\n there is present invention of a very high order. In another\n we can see that there is lacking that impalpable something\n which distinguishes invention from simple mechanical\n skill.”). Congress did away with the requirement in the\n 1952 Patent Act and, instead, directed courts to assess\n whether the invention was nonobvious, codifying that con-\n cept in 35 U.S.C. § 103.\n\fCase: 19-2198     Document: 80     Page: 3      Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                 3\n\n\n\n that characterization for the court-created exceptions to\n what constitutes patentable subject matter under\n 35 U.S.C. § 101. Because those exceptions are complex and\n their application is reviewed de novo, district courts might\n be tempted to opt for an effective coin toss rather than a\n reasoned analysis when faced with a challenge under\n § 101. This is especially so where the abstract idea excep-\n tion is invoked. But the system is not supposed to work\n that way. The parties are entitled to more and the Court\n of Appeals needs more.\n     A district court opinion “must contain sufficient find-\n ings and reasoning to permit meaningful appellate scru-\n tiny.” Gechter v. Davidson, 116 F.3d 1454, 1458 (Fed. Cir.\n 1997). Although we have said that we review judgments,\n not opinions, King Instrument Corp. v. Otari Corp., 767\n F.2d 853, 862 (Fed. Cir. 1985), where a district court has\n offered no reasoning for us to review we may, and most of-\n ten do, decline to analyze a legal question in the first in-\n stance. Proveris Sci. Corp. v. Innovasystems, Inc., 739 F.3d\n 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n     Realtime Data LLC (“Realtime”) appeals from a bench\n ruling of the United States District Court for the District\n of Delaware holding all 159 claims of U.S. Patent Nos.\n 7,415,530 (“’530 patent”), 8,717,203 (“’203 patent”),\n 9,054,728 (“’728 patent”), 9,116,908 (“’908 patent”), and\n 9,667,751 (“’751 patent”) (collectively “patents-in-suit”) pa-\n tent ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101. See J.A. 52–59. Be-\n cause this case presents one of those rare circumstances in\n which a district court’s treatment of a complex and close\n legal issue is too cursory to allow for meaningful appellate\n review, we vacate and remand for the district court to give\n additional consideration to the eligibility question and\n elaborate on its reasoning.\n\fCase: 19-2198     Document: 80      Page: 4     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                 REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n                        I. BACKGROUND\n                    A. The Patents-in-Suit\n      The patents-in-suit all relate, at a high level, to meth-\n ods and systems for digital data compression. The ’728 pa-\n tent and ’203 patent, which are in the same family and\n share a common specification, are titled “Data Compres-\n sion Systems and Methods.” The patents’ written descrip-\n tions explain the problem of “data dependency” in prior art\n systems. “Data dependency” is “content sensitive behav-\n ior” that means “the compression ratio achieved is highly\n contingent upon the content of the data being compressed.”\n ’728 patent, col. 2, ll. 29–35. One prior art solution was to\n select a compression technique based on “file type de-\n scriptors” (e.g., .doc, .txt, or .pdf) that are used to identify\n “the application programs that normally act upon the data\n contained within the file.” Id. at col. 3, ll. 2–5. The written\n descriptions explain, however, that this solution’s efficacy\n is limited by the sheer number and rate of development of\n application program types. Id. at col. 3, ll. 9–19. The writ-\n ten descriptions further describe a system for data com-\n pression that looks beyond the file type descriptor, to the\n underlying data, to complete the desired compression. See\n generally id. at col. 3, l. 59–col. 5, l. 11.\n     The ’908 patent and the ’530 patent, which are in the\n same family and share a common specification, are titled\n “System and Methods for Accelerated Data Storage and Re-\n trieval.” The patents’ written descriptions explain that the\n disclosed invention relates to “improving data storage and\n retrieval bandwidth utilizing lossless data compression\n and decompression.” ’908 patent, col. 1, ll. 17–18. The\n written descriptions describe certain drawbacks found in\n prior art systems, including that they did not adequately\n account for hardware limitations. Id. at col. 2, ll. 34–45.\n The patents’ disclosed invention purports to overcome\n these limitations by, for example, selecting encoding tech-\n niques “based upon their ability to effectively encode\n\fCase: 19-2198     Document: 80     Page: 5      Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                 5\n\n\n\n different types of input data.” Id. at col. 12, ll. 5–7. The\n written descriptions explain that this is meant “to elimi-\n nate the complexity and additional processing overhead as-\n sociated    with    multiplexing      concurrent     encoding\n techniques.” Id. at col. 12, ll. 31–33.\n     The ’751 patent is titled “Data Feed Acceleration” and\n relates to “systems and method for providing accelerated\n transmission of data . . . over a communication channel us-\n ing data compression and decompression to . . . effectively\n increase the bandwidth of the communication channel\n and/or reduce the latency of data transmission.” ’751 pa-\n tent, col 1., ll. 27–36. The ’751 patent’s written description\n describes drawbacks in the prior art, including that “cur-\n rent methods of encryption and compression take as much\n or substantially more time than the actual time to transmit\n the uncompressed, unencrypted data.” Id. at col. 3, ll. 31–\n 33. The disclosed invention purports to solve these prob-\n lems via a “data compression ratio [that] is substantial and\n repeatable on each data packet” that has “no packet-to-\n packet data dependency.” Id. at col. 7, ll. 55–66.\n      The patents-in-suit and members of their patent fami-\n lies have been widely litigated. See Appellees’ Br. 14 n.1\n (collecting cases). Of particular relevance to this appeal,\n Magistrate Judge John D. Love of the Eastern District of\n Texas considered the patent eligibility of the ’728, ’530, and\n ’908 patents, as well as the eligibility of members of the\n ’203 and ’751 patents’ families, in two separate cases. See\n Realtime Data, LLC v. Carbonite, Inc., No. 6:17-CV-00121,\n 2017 WL 4693969 (E.D. Tex. Sept. 20, 2017), report and\n recommendation adopted, No. 1:17-cv-12499-WGY (D.\n Mass. March 7, 2018), ECF No. 97; Realtime Data, LLC v.\n Actian Corp., No. 6:15-CV-463-RWS-JDL, 2015 WL\n 11089485 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 30, 2015), report and recommen-\n dation adopted, 2016 WL 259581 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 21, 2016).\n In each case, Judge Love recommended that the challenged\n claims be deemed patent eligible at both Alice step 1 and\n step 2. His reports and recommendations were fully\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 6    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n adopted by two different district court judges—Judge Rob-\n ert W. Schroeder III of the Eastern District of Texas and,\n due to an intervening transfer, Judge William G. Young of\n the District of Massachusetts—each with significant expe-\n rience in patent cases.\n                B. District Court Proceedings\n     Realtime filed suit alleging infringement of various\n combinations of the claims of the patents-in-suit against\n Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet”) and Reduxio Systems, Inc. (“Re-\n duxio”) in November 2017, against Panzura, Inc. (“Pan-\n zura”) in August 2018, and against Aryaka Networks, Inc.\n (“Aryaka”) in December 2018. Fortinet, Reduxio, Panzura,\n and Aryaka (collectively “defendants”) filed motions to dis-\n miss the suits for failure to state a claim in early 2019.\n Among other things, the defendants argued that all 159\n claims of the patents-in-suit are patent ineligible under 35\n U.S.C. § 101.\n      Pursuant to a June 10, 2019 order, the parties were in-\n structed to submit a letter to the court in advance of oral\n argument identifying “which Supreme Court or Federal\n Circuit case that party contends is most similar to the chal-\n lenged claim(s).” See, e.g., Order, Realtime Data LLC v.\n Fortinet, Inc., No. 17-cv-01635-CFC (D. Del. June 10,\n 2019), ECF No. 51. Defendants identified RecogniCorp,\n LLC v. Nintendo Co., 855 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2017). See,\n e.g., Letter, Realtime Data LLC v. Fortinet, Inc., No. 17-cv-\n 01635-CFC (D. Del. July 3, 2019), ECF No. 56. Realtime\n pointed to Visual Memory LLC v. Nvidia Corp., 867 F.3d\n 1253 (Fed. Cir. 2017). See Letter, Realtime Data LLC v.\n Fortinet, Inc., No. 17-cv-01635-CFC (D. Del. July 3, 2019),\n ECF No. 57.\n     On July 19, 2019, the district court heard argument on\n the motions to dismiss. The proceeding lasted two hours\n and eight minutes, including a recess. The argument fo-\n cused primarily on claim 25 of the ’751 patent. See J.A.\n 29–51. The district court asked numerous questions of\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 7      Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                 7\n\n\n\n Realtime—focusing on individual claim elements and ask-\n ing Realtime to explain what made the claim “novel.” See\n J.A. 33–34. At one point, the district court interjected that\n the solution claimed in the ’751 patent was “obvious—it’s\n just stating the obvious.” J.A. 48. The court then clarified,\n “I don’t mean obviousness in the patent sense. I mean it is\n obvious like it’s common sense.” Id. While Realtime’s\n counsel attempted to focus the court to the question of\n whether the claims were directed to an improvement on ex-\n isting technology, as opposed to mere use of such technol-\n ogy, the court did not appear to consider that question. See\n J.A. 42–46. Having dissected claim 25 of the ’751 patent,\n the district court ended the argument. See J.A. 52.\n     Following a short recess, the district court announced\n it was “prepared to rule on the pending motions” and ex-\n plained it would “not be issuing written opinions.” J.A. 52.\n The transcript would serve as its ruling on all pending mo-\n tions. The court stated that it had “followed a thorough\n process before making the decision,” including considering\n the briefing and engaging in oral argument, J.A. 52, but its\n complete oral analysis of the patent eligibility of the 159\n claims in the asserted patents fills only five pages of tran-\n script. J.A. 53–57. At the end of those five pages, the court\n declared all claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,415,530,\n 8,717,203, 9,054,728, 9,116,908, and 9,667,751 patent inel-\n igible. J.A. 57.\n     After the district court announced its ruling, Realtime\n asked for the court’s decision on its request for leave to\n amend its complaints. J.A. 59. The district court re-\n sponded, “my practice has been to ignore [requests for leave\n to amend] and just to grant a motion to dismiss.” J.A. 60.\n Although the district court conceded that “reasonable peo-\n ple can disagree” on the eligibility of the asserted claims,\n J.A. 58, it denied Realtime’s request for leave to amend its\n complaint. J.A. 63. (“I think you can take your issues up\n with the Federal Circuit, and if I’m wrong, I’m wrong.”).\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 8    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n     Judgment was entered in each case on July 29, 2019.\n J.A. 1–8. Realtime timely appealed. We have jurisdiction\n pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).\n                       II. DISCUSSION\n      Courts must assess the patent eligibility of claims via\n the two-part test established by the Supreme Court in Alice\n Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. 208 (2014). At\n Alice step 1, a court must “determine whether the claims\n at issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept.” Id. at\n 218. Patent ineligible concepts include laws of nature, nat-\n ural phenomena, and abstract ideas. A court’s determina-\n tion of whether a claim is directed to one of those patent\n ineligible concepts must consider individual claim ele-\n ments and the elements as an ordered combination. Id. at\n 217. At Alice step 2, a court must decide whether the\n claims contain an “inventive concept” such that “the patent\n in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent\n upon the [ineligible concept] itself.” Id. at 217–18 (altera-\n tion in original) (quoting Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Pro-\n metheus Labs., Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 73 (2012)).\n     The ultimate determination of patent eligibility under\n 35 U.S.C. § 101 is a question of law that we review de novo.\n Berkheimer v. HP Inc., 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir.\n 2018). That we have de novo review does not, however,\n mean that we are a court of first view. Despite the stand-\n ard of review that we apply, we remain a court of appeal\n not a court of original jurisdiction. Compare Original Ju-\n risdiction, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (“A\n court’s power to hear and decide a matter before any other\n court can review the matter.”), with Appellate Jurisdiction,\n id. (“The power of a court to review and revise a lower\n court’s decision.”). District courts have an obligation to\n provide us with a reviewable decision, commensurate with\n the issues before it. See Nazomi Commc’ns, Inc. v. ARM\n Holdings, PLC, 403 F.3d 1364, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2005)\n (“[T]his court must be furnished ‘sufficient findings and\n\fCase: 19-2198      Document: 80      Page: 9     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                   9\n\n\n\n reasoning to permit meaningful appellate scrutiny.’ This\n requirement for sufficient reasoning applies with equal\n force to issues of law . . . and issues of fact . . . .” (quoting\n Gechter, 116 F.3d at 1458)). De novo appellate review cer-\n tainly does not justify resolving a complex legal issue with-\n out an opinion or reasoned analysis. Unfortunately, that\n is exactly the type of improper justification the district\n court proffered in this case. See J.A. 55 (district court dis-\n cussing the de novo standard of review and concluding\n “[t]hat’s why I’m not going to write anymore”); see also id.\n (“[M]aybe Realtime is right and the Federal Circuit panel\n will say differently and will have that opportunity to do\n that.”).\n      We hold, on the record presented to us on appeal, that\n the district court’s short analysis is insufficient to facilitate\n meaningful appellate review. We are particularly con-\n cerned with four shortcomings in the court’s process:\n (1) the colloquy between the court and Realtime indicates\n an apparently improper focus on factual questions that are\n unsuitable for resolution at the pleading stage and a failure\n to evaluate the claims as a whole; (2) to the extent the dis-\n trict court purported to resolve the “directed to” question of\n Alice step 1, its process is unclear and its conclusion ques-\n tionable; (3) the court did not address or even acknowledge\n Judge Love’s lengthy written opinions, which were adopted\n by two district courts, addressing the precise question\n faced by the court; and (4) although, as the district court\n requested, Realtime identified Visual Memory LLC v.\n NVIDIA Corp., 867 F.3d 1253 (Fed. Cir. 2017), as the case\n most analogous to this one and directed the court to our\n decision in Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327\n (Fed. Cir. 2016), and DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com,\n L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the district court failed\n to address or distinguish those cases.\n      First, the colloquy between the district court and\n Realtime leaves us unclear as to the true basis for the dis-\n trict court’s decision. Rather than focus first on whether\n\fCase: 19-2198     Document: 80      Page: 10     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                REALTIME DATA LLC    v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n the claims are “directed to” an abstract idea as we ex-\n plained in Enfish is the initial inquiry in cases like this, the\n district court repeatedly inquired whether claim limita-\n tions were “novel.” See, e.g., J.A. 33 (“The Court: You are\n not going to tell me it’s novel to have a data server imple-\n mented on one or more processors, are you?”); id. at 34\n (“The Court: Well, at the end, you can tell me what’s novel\n about the configuration, so we’ll come back to that.”). The\n district court later expressed a view that the claimed in-\n vention of the ’751 patent was “obvious”—but not in the pa-\n tent sense, “like it’s common sense.” Id. at 48. Novelty and\n nonobviousness are well-established patent law doctrines\n and, though they are not wholly divorced from some as-\n pects of the § 101 inquiry, they are rarely issues appropri-\n ate for resolution on the pleadings. That is especially true\n where, as here, Realtime repeatedly contested as factually\n incorrect propositions posited by the district court. See,\n e.g., J.A. 45–46. Those concepts, moreover, are not part of\n the Alice step 1 inquiry, they relate, if at all, to step 2. And,\n to the extent the court was influenced by its subjective un-\n derstanding of “common sense,” that is plainly irrelevant.\n     Nothing in the discussion between the court and\n Realtime leads us to understand that the district court con-\n sidered the claims as a whole or, for that matter, seriously\n considered any claims beyond claim 25 of the ’751 patent.\n With the little we have before us, it is hard, if not impossi-\n ble, to put the district court’s commentary out of mind.\n And, it is difficult to discern what part of the court’s con-\n cerns with the claims were directed to which step of the\n Alice analysis.\n     Second, to the extent the court purported to answer the\n Alice step 1 “directed to” question, it is unclear that it did\n so correctly. One critical shortcoming in the district court’s\n analysis is a failure to identify which, if any, claims are\n representative. Although the court articulated a “fair de-\n scription” of each patent-in-suit, J.A. 56, it failed to tie\n those descriptions to any specific claim or to clarify\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 11     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.               11\n\n\n\n whether those descriptions are the abstract ideas that the\n claims are “directed to” within the meaning of § 101 juris-\n prudence. It is, of course, incorrect to consider whether a\n patent as a whole is abstract. The analysis is claim spe-\n cific. If, as we suspect, the district court’s analysis simply\n generalized the claims, absent a finding of the representa-\n tiveness of certain claims and without considering the “di-\n rected to” inquiry, that was error.\n      We further question the district court’s statements that\n the claims are, to use the ’728 patent as an example, merely\n “choosing a compression method based on the data type.”\n J.A. 56. This statement seems to miss that the claims ex-\n pressly achieve this result in certain ways, involving exam-\n ining data blocks and not relying just on a descriptor. See\n ’728 patent, claim 24. Without more analysis, we cannot\n identify the district court’s reasons for omitting key aspects\n of the claims and we cannot say whether that rationale was\n sound. It appears, however, that the district court improp-\n erly equated the presence of an abstract idea with a conclu-\n sion that the claims are directed to such an idea. Mayo,\n 566 U.S. at 71 (“[A]ll inventions at some level embody, use,\n reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenom-\n ena, or abstract ideas.”). On remand, we caution the dis-\n trict court away from sweeping generalizations and\n encourage the court to carefully consider the “directed to”\n question once more.\n     Third, as we discuss above, the patents-in-suit and\n their relatives have been subject to § 101 scrutiny in the\n past. Two district court judges and one magistrate judge,\n across two judicial districts, have separately considered\n whether the claims are patent eligible and concluded that\n they are. This is not to say that those judges were neces-\n sarily correct in their assessment of this issue nor that the\n court was bound by those conclusions. We mean only to say\n that, when deciding the motions to dismiss in this case, the\n court should have, at a minimum, provided a considered\n explanation as to why those judges were wrong. This could\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80     Page: 12    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12               REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n have been done expressly; the court could have cited the\n earlier cases and distinguished them. Or the analysis\n could have been implied; the court could have analyzed the\n arguments for eligibility in such a way that the reasons for\n the differing conclusions are apparent. Here, however, ra-\n ther than take either approach, the court recited a series of\n legal conclusions and § 101 cases, without analysis. That\n simply was not enough.\n      Fourth, the district court asked each party to identify\n a single case that most closely supports its position on the\n eligibility of the claims. Defendants selected RecogniCorp.\n The district court mentioned RecogniCorp in its oral opin-\n ion. It articulated the holding of that case as, “noting that\n processes that start with data and add in an algorithm and\n end with a new form of data are directed to an abstract\n idea.” J.A. 54. It then concluded, without explanation,\n “[t]hat’s what we have here.” Id. Prior to argument,\n Realtime identified Visual Memory. It argued that the case\n was analogous during the colloquy. J.A. 50–51. As noted,\n Realtime also advocated that Enfish and DDR Holdings\n are analogous. J.A. 28, 44. The district court, however,\n never mentioned Visual Memory, Enfish, or DDR, much\n less distinguished them. We do not today opine on the mer-\n its of Realtime’s contention that its patents are akin to the\n patent eligible claims of Visual Memory or to any of the\n other cases where our court has found claims to be patent\n eligible. We merely note that, by not addressing even the\n one case held out as most comparable by Realtime, the dis-\n trict court did not do enough. 2\n\n\n\n      2   This is an important failure. Assessments of pa-\n tent eligibility are best done by reference to our numerous\n cases engaging in those assessments and gleaning insight\n from the resolutions. As that exercise reveals, there are\n often very fine lines between those cases and between what\n is patent eligible and what is not. A detailed analysis of\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 13     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.               13\n\n\n\n     To be clear, we do not hold that a written order is al-\n ways necessary. There are indeed times, even on a case\n dispositive motion, where an oral order is enough. We have\n seen and affirmed several such orders in the past. This\n case is unique, however, in its paucity of analysis and the\n closeness of the underlying legal issue. Our conclusion that\n the district court must do more in this case is reinforced,\n moreover, by the fact that through its abbreviated process\n the district court eviscerated five of Realtime’s patents and\n completely resolved four separate district court actions.\n While much can be said on the benefits of judicial effi-\n ciency, the process used here strays beyond efficient to the\n realm of insufficient. 3\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n     For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the district\n court’s judgments and remand for further proceedings con-\n sistent with this opinion. Nothing in this opinion should\n be read as opining on the relative merits of the parties’ ar-\n guments or the proper resolution of the case.\n\n\n\n\n those cases and the record before the district court is often\n needed if we are to appropriately assess the court’s resolu-\n tion of a § 101 challenge.\n      3   Because we vacate the district court’s judgment, we\n need not decide whether the district court abused its dis-\n cretion by denying Realtime’s request for leave to amend\n its complaints. We are concerned, however, with the dis-\n trict court’s statement that its blanket practice is to deny\n such requests. Factual allegations in a complaint can suf-\n fice to overcome Alice step 2 and district courts should, as\n in any civil case, freely grant leave to amend to allege the\n necessary facts.

CLS Bank\n Int’l, 573 U.S. 208 (2014), is an accurate identification of\n the focus of the claimed advance at Alice’s Step 1, to be\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 16    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 2                REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n followed (if necessary) by an accurate identification of all\n specifics of the claims at Alice’s Step 2. At both stages, it\n is important to avoid “overgeneralizing [the] claims,”\n Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327, 1337 (Fed.\n Cir. 2016), i.e., “‘oversimplifying the claims’ by looking at\n them generally and failing to account for the[ir] specific\n requirements,” McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games\n America, Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2016). At\n Alice’s Step 1, a claim must be “considered in light of the\n specification” to identify “the focus of the claimed advance.”\n Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1335; Solutran, Inc. v. Elavon, Inc., 931\n F.3d 1161, 1168 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks\n omitted). In particular, that identification is crucial to\n applying what is in the present cases the key doctrinal\n distinction—derived from Alice, 573 U.S. at 225—between\n using unimproved computers and networks as tools and\n improving computers or networks as tools, i.e., improving\n basic computer or network functions themselves (e.g.,\n processing, memory, input/output, transmission) in\n specific ways, see Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1335–36; see also\n Uniloc USA, Inc. v. LG Electronics USA, Inc., 957 F.3d\n 1303, 1306–07 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (citing cases). Identifying\n claim specifics is also crucial at Alice’s Step 2—to\n determining whether the claim contains limitations that,\n alone or in combination, are not aspects of the ineligible\n matter itself and (if they are not) go beyond “‘well-\n understood, routine, conventional activit[ies]’ previously\n known in the industry.” Alice, 573 U.S. at 225 (alteration\n in original) (citation omitted).\n     In the present cases, the district court erred at the\n foundational stage. In the decision-announcing part of the\n July 19, 2019 hearing, the court characterized the claims\n without mention of what, for at least some (perhaps all) of\n the claims at issue, the claim language and specifications\n make clear are important parts of what the patents assert\n are the advances in the art. For example, the court de-\n scribed claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 9,054,728 as a system for\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 17     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                3\n\n\n\n “choosing a compression method based on the data type.”\n J.A. 56. That description disregards claim language re-\n quiring that the identification of data type rely on exami-\n nation of data blocks and not on a file extension or\n comparable descriptor of the data type. ’728 patent, col. 26,\n lines 29–48 (“to analyze data within a data block to identify\n one or more parameters or attributes of the data wherein\n the analyzing of the data within the data block to identify\n the one or more parameters or attributes of the data ex-\n cludes analyzing based solely on a descriptor that is indic-\n ative of the one or more parameters or attributes of the\n data within the data block”). The specification describes\n that data-examination basis for choosing a compressor\n method as one of the claimed advances over the prior art.\n Id., cols. 3, 4. The district court’s truncated characteriza-\n tion of claim 1 of the ’728 patent, and of some or all of the\n other claims at issue, created an incorrect starting point for\n the required analysis.\n      A seemingly related error appears in the portion of the\n July 2019 hearing devoted to colloquies between the dis-\n trict court and counsel. Although such colloquies are in-\n trinsically only exploratory, and thus could easily have\n been superseded by the court’s articulation of its rationale\n in the decisional portion of the hearing, in these cases the\n court’s statements in the two portions align. In the collo-\n quy portion, the district court made statements suggesting\n adoption of a premise that the Alice test might be flunked\n solely because the claimed systems and methods use hard-\n ware components such as processors, servers, and memory.\n See J.A. 33–41. To the extent that the district court\n adopted that premise, it was mistaken. Eligibility analysis\n in cases like these requires consideration of whether the\n hardware components have been configured by program-\n ming to improve their basic functionalities (e.g., processing\n functions, memory functions, input/output functions,\n transmission functions) in specific ways.               Such\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 18     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n improvements can be eligible subject matter under Enfish\n and many later cases.\n     The error at the foundational stage in these cases is not\n a matter of choosing among an often-available range of for-\n mulations that are relatively minor variations in how to\n describe the claims for both Step 1 and Step 2 purposes.\n The error here is far more basic, and more consequential\n for the conduct of a sound analysis. The district court es-\n sentially disregarded limitations, in at least some of the\n patent claims at issue, that are part of the focus of the as-\n serted advances. Because the court overgeneralized, or\n oversimplified, the claims in that fundamental way, the\n court in effect failed to conduct the inquiries required un-\n der the branch of § 101 doctrine relevant here.\n      The § 101 inquiries demand close attention to the spe-\n cific content of the patent claims at issue; the specifics mat-\n ter under the growing body of precedents that provide both\n significant analytical distinctions and fact-specific judg-\n ments important to the assessment of later-litigated facts.\n At least since Alice was decided, it has become clear that\n sometimes those inquiries lead quickly, and without the\n need for extensive discussion, to a conclusion that a claim,\n despite its length, is merely elaborating on what are all ab-\n stract ideas or reciting the details of what are conventional\n tools of implementation. See, e.g., Electric Power Group,\n LLC v. Alstrom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016). But\n the present cases are in a more challenging category, be-\n cause the claims, on their face and understood in light of\n the specifications, purport to solve engineering problems in\n the transfer of data. Whatever conclusion is ultimately\n reached for the claims before us, these cases require a\n sounder starting point, and a more extensive analysis, than\n the district court provided.\n      In these cases, I agree that it is appropriate to take\n what is, and should remain, the unusual step of remanding\n for reconsideration of the § 101 issue without ruling on the\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 19     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                 5\n\n\n\n issue ourselves. A remand will allow the district court to\n characterize the claims more accurately and, on that new\n basis, to consider relevant precedents of this court that the\n district court did not address, including a number of post-\n July 2019 precedents that provide clarifying guidance con-\n cerning the inquiries pertinent to the analysis in cases like\n the ones before us. See, e.g., TecSec, Inc. v. Adobe Inc., Nos.\n 2019-2192, -2258 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 23, 2020), slip op. at 20–31\n (citing and discussing cases); Packet Intelligence LLC v.\n NetScout Sys., Inc., 965 F.3d 1299, 1309–10 (Fed. Cir.\n 2020); Uniloc, 957 F.3d at 1306–07; Ericsson Inc. v. TCL\n Commc’n Tech. Holdings Ltd., 955 F.3d 1317, 1327–28\n (Fed. Cir. 2020); Customedia Techs., LLC v.

Cisco Systems,\n Inc., 930 F.3d 1295, 1303–04 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (mid-July\n 2019). A remand will also allow the district court, should\n Step 2 be reached, to reconsider, after a re-focused analysis\n proceeding through the Step 1 and Step 2 inquiries,\n whether the filing of amended complaints should be per-\n mitted. I therefore concur in the judgment of the court.\n\f",

The Patents-in-Suit\n      The patents-in-suit all relate, at a high level, to meth-\n ods and systems for digital data compression. The ’728 pa-\n tent and ’203 patent, which are in the same family and\n share a common specification, are titled “Data Compres-\n sion Systems and Methods.” The patents’ written descrip-\n tions explain the problem of “data dependency” in prior art\n systems. “Data dependency” is “content sensitive behav-\n ior” that means “the compression ratio achieved is highly\n contingent upon the content of the data being compressed.”\n ’728 patent, col. 2, ll. 29–35. One prior art solution was to\n select a compression technique based on “file type de-\n scriptors” (e.g., .doc, .txt, or .pdf) that are used to identify\n “the application programs that normally act upon the data\n contained within the file.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at </span><pre class=\"inline\">col. 3, ll. 2–5.

The ’751 patent’s written description\n describes drawbacks in the prior art, including that “cur-\n rent methods of encryption and compression take as much\n or substantially more time than the actual time to transmit\n the uncompressed, unencrypted data.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at </span><pre class=\"inline\">col. 3, ll. 31–\n 33.

District Court Proceedings\n     Realtime filed suit alleging infringement of various\n combinations of the claims of the patents-in-suit against\n Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet”) and Reduxio Systems, Inc. (“Re-\n duxio”) in November 2017, against Panzura, Inc. (“Pan-\n zura”) in August 2018, and against Aryaka Networks, Inc.\n (“Aryaka”) in December 2018. Fortinet, Reduxio, Panzura,\n and Aryaka (collectively “defendants”) filed motions to dis-\n miss the suits for failure to state a claim in early 2019.\n Among other things, the defendants argued that all 159\n claims of the patents-in-suit are patent ineligible under 35\n U.S.C. § 101.\n      Pursuant to a June 10, 2019 order, the parties were in-\n structed to submit a letter to the court in advance of oral\n argument identifying “which Supreme Court or Federal\n Circuit case that party contends is most similar to the chal-\n lenged claim(s).” See, e.g., Order, Realtime Data LLC v.\n Fortinet, Inc., No. 17-cv-01635-CFC (D.

The argument fo-\n cused primarily on claim 25 of the ’751 patent. See J.A.\n 29–51. The district court asked numerous questions of\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 7      Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.                 7\n\n\n\n Realtime—focusing on individual claim elements and ask-\n ing Realtime to explain what made the claim “novel.” See\n J.A. 33–34. At one point, the district court interjected that\n the solution claimed in the ’751 patent was “obvious—it’s\n just stating the obvious.” J.A. 48. The court then clarified,\n “I don’t mean obviousness in the patent sense. I mean it is\n obvious like it’s common sense.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> While Realtime’s\n counsel </span><pre class=\"inline\">attempted to focus the court to the question of\n whether the claims were directed to an improvement on ex-\n isting technology, as opposed to mere use of such technol-\n ogy, the court did not appear to consider that question. See\n J.A. 42–46. Having dissected claim 25 of the ’751 patent,\n the district court ended the argument. See J.A. 52.\n     Following a short recess, the district court announced\n it was “prepared to rule on the pending motions” and ex-\n plained it would “not be issuing written opinions.” J.A. 52.\n The transcript would serve as its ruling on all pending mo-\n tions. The court stated that it had “followed a thorough\n process before making the decision,” including considering\n the briefing and engaging in oral argument, J.A. 52, but its\n complete oral analysis of the patent eligibility of the 159\n claims in the asserted patents fills only five pages of tran-\n script. J.A. 53–57. At the end of those five pages, the court\n declared all claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,415,530,\n 8,717,203, 9,054,728, 9,116,908, and 9,667,751 patent inel-\n igible. J.A. 57.\n     After the district court announced its ruling, Realtime\n asked for the court’s decision on its request for leave to\n amend its complaints. J.A. 59. The district court re-\n sponded, “my practice has been to ignore [requests for leave\n to amend] and just to grant a motion to dismiss.” J.A. 60.\n Although the district court conceded that “reasonable peo-\n ple can disagree” on the eligibility of the asserted claims,\n J.A. 58, it denied Realtime’s request for leave to amend its\n complaint.

Rather than focus first on whether\n\fCase: 19-2198     Document: 80      Page: 10     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                REALTIME DATA LLC    v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n the claims are “directed to” an abstract idea as we ex-\n plained in Enfish is the initial inquiry in cases like this, the\n district court repeatedly inquired whether claim limita-\n tions were “novel.” See, e.g., J.A. 33 (“The Court: You are\n not going to tell me it’s novel to have a data server imple-\n mented on one or more processors, are you?”);</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at </span><pre class=\"inline\">34\n (“The Court: Well, at the end, you can tell me what’s novel\n about the configuration, so we’ll come back to that.”). The\n district court later expressed a view that the claimed in-\n vention of the ’751 patent was “obvious”—but not in the pa-\n tent sense, “like it’s common sense.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at </span><pre class=\"inline\">48. Novelty and\n nonobviousness are well-established patent law doctrines\n and, though they are not wholly divorced from some as-\n pects of the § 101 inquiry, they are rarely issues appropri-\n ate for resolution on the pleadings. That is especially true\n where, as here, Realtime repeatedly contested as factually\n incorrect propositions posited by the district court. See,\n e.g., J.A. 45–46. Those concepts, moreover, are not part of\n the Alice step 1 inquiry, they relate, if at all, to step 2. And,\n to the extent the court was influenced by its subjective un-\n derstanding of “common sense,” that is plainly irrelevant.\n     Nothing in the discussion between the court and\n Realtime leads us to understand that the district court con-\n sidered the claims as a whole or, for that matter, seriously\n considered any claims beyond claim 25 of the ’751 patent.\n With the little we have before us, it is hard, if not impossi-\n ble, to put the district court’s commentary out of mind.\n And, it is difficult to discern what part of the court’s con-\n cerns with the claims were directed to which step of the\n Alice analysis.\n     Second, to the extent the court purported to answer the\n Alice step 1 “directed to” question, it is unclear that it did\n so correctly. One critical shortcoming in the district court’s\n analysis is a failure to identify which, if any, claims are\n representative. Although the court articulated a “fair de-\n scription” of each patent-in-suit, J.A. 56, it failed to tie\n those descriptions to any specific claim or to clarify\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 11     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.               11\n\n\n\n whether those descriptions are the abstract ideas that the\n claims are “directed to” within the meaning of § 101 juris-\n prudence. It is, of course, incorrect to consider whether a\n patent as a whole is abstract. The analysis is claim spe-\n cific. If, as we suspect, the district court’s analysis simply\n generalized the claims, absent a finding of the representa-\n tiveness of certain claims and without considering the “di-\n rected to” inquiry, that was error.\n      We further question the district court’s statements that\n the claims are, to use the ’728 patent as an example, merely\n “choosing a compression method based on the data type.”\n J.A. 56. This statement seems to miss that the claims ex-\n pressly achieve this result in certain ways, involving exam-\n ining data blocks and not relying just on a descriptor. See\n ’728 patent, claim 24. Without more analysis, we cannot\n identify the district court’s reasons for omitting key aspects\n of the claims and we cannot say whether that rationale was\n sound. It appears, however, that the district court improp-\n erly equated the presence of an abstract idea with a conclu-\n sion that the claims are directed to such an idea. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625710\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Mayo,</span>\n <a href=\"/opinion/625710/mayo-collaborative-services-v-prometheus-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> at <span class=\"page\">71</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(“[A]ll inventions at some level embody, use,\n reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenom-\n ena, or abstract ideas.”).

Two district court judges and one magistrate judge,\n across two judicial districts, have separately considered\n whether the claims are patent eligible and concluded that\n they are. This is not to say that those judges were neces-\n sarily correct in their assessment of this issue nor that the\n court was bound by those conclusions. We mean only to say\n that, when deciding the motions to dismiss in this case, the\n court should have, at a minimum, provided a considered\n explanation as to why those judges were wrong. This could\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80     Page: 12    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12               REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n have been done expressly; the court could have cited the\n earlier cases and distinguished them. Or the analysis\n could have been implied; the court could have analyzed the\n arguments for eligibility in such a way that the reasons for\n the differing conclusions are apparent. Here, however, ra-\n ther than take either approach, the court recited a series of\n legal conclusions and § 101 cases, without analysis. That\n simply was not enough.\n      Fourth, the district court asked each party to identify\n a single case that most closely supports its position on the\n eligibility of the claims. Defendants selected RecogniCorp.\n The district court mentioned RecogniCorp in its oral opin-\n ion. It articulated the holding of that case as, “noting that\n processes that start with data and add in an algorithm and\n end with a new form of data are directed to an abstract\n idea.” J.A. 54. It then concluded, without explanation,\n “[t]hat’s what we have here.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Prior to argument,\n</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Realtime identified Visual Memory. It argued that the case\n was analogous during the colloquy. J.A. 50–51. As noted,\n Realtime also advocated that Enfish and DDR Holdings\n are analogous. J.A. 28, 44. The district court, however,\n never mentioned Visual Memory, Enfish, or DDR, much\n less distinguished them. We do not today opine on the mer-\n its of Realtime’s contention that its patents are akin to the\n patent eligible claims of Visual Memory or to any of the\n other cases where our court has found claims to be patent\n eligible. We merely note that, by not addressing even the\n one case held out as most comparable by Realtime, the dis-\n trict court did not do enough. 2\n\n\n\n      2   This is an important failure. Assessments of pa-\n tent eligibility are best done by reference to our numerous\n cases engaging in those assessments and gleaning insight\n from the resolutions. As that exercise reveals, there are\n often very fine lines between those cases and between what\n is patent eligible and what is not. A detailed analysis of\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 13     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.               13\n\n\n\n     To be clear, we do not hold that a written order is al-\n ways necessary. There are indeed times, even on a case\n dispositive motion, where an oral order is enough. We have\n seen and affirmed several such orders in the past. This\n case is unique, however, in its paucity of analysis and the\n closeness of the underlying legal issue. Our conclusion that\n the district court must do more in this case is reinforced,\n moreover, by the fact that through its abbreviated process\n the district court eviscerated five of Realtime’s patents and\n completely resolved four separate district court actions.\n While much can be said on the benefits of judicial effi-\n ciency, the process used here strays beyond efficient to the\n realm of insufficient. 3\n                       III. CONCLUSION\n     For the reasons discussed above, we vacate the district\n court’s judgments and remand for further proceedings con-\n sistent with this opinion. Nothing in this opinion should\n be read as opining on the relative merits of the parties’ ar-\n guments or the proper resolution of the case.\n\n\n\n\n those cases and the record before the district court is often\n needed if we are to appropriately assess the court’s resolu-\n tion of a § 101 challenge.\n      3   Because we vacate the district court’s judgment, we\n need not decide whether the district court abused its dis-\n cretion by denying Realtime’s request for leave to amend\n its complaints. We are concerned, however, with the dis-\n trict court’s statement that its blanket practice is to deny\n such requests. Factual allegations in a complaint can suf-\n fice to overcome Alice step 2 and district courts should, as\n in any civil case, freely grant leave to amend to allege the\n necessary facts.

For example, the court de-\n scribed claim 1 of U.S. Patent No. 9,054,728 as a system for\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 17     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v.

That description disregards claim language re-\n quiring that the identification of data type rely on exami-\n nation of data blocks and not on a file extension or\n comparable descriptor of the data type. ’728 patent, col. 26,\n lines 29–48 (“to analyze data within a data block to identify\n one or more parameters or attributes of the data wherein\n the analyzing of the data within the data block to identify\n the one or more parameters or attributes of the data ex-\n cludes analyzing based solely on a descriptor that is indic-\n ative of the one or more parameters or attributes of the\n data within the data block”).

Although such colloquies are in-\n trinsically only exploratory, and thus could easily have\n been superseded by the court’s articulation of its rationale\n in the decisional portion of the hearing, in these cases the\n court’s statements in the two portions align. In the collo-\n quy portion, the district court made statements suggesting\n adoption of a premise that the Alice test might be flunked\n solely because the claimed systems and methods use hard-\n ware components such as processors, servers, and memory.\n See J.A. 33–41. To the extent that the district court\n adopted that premise, it was mistaken. Eligibility analysis\n in cases like these requires consideration of whether the\n hardware components have been configured by program-\n ming to improve their basic functionalities (e.g., processing\n functions, memory functions, input/output functions,\n transmission functions) in specific ways.               Such\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 18     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                REALTIME DATA LLC   v. REDUXIO SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n\n\n improvements can be eligible subject matter under Enfish\n and many later cases.\n     The error at the foundational stage in these cases is not\n a matter of choosing among an often-available range of for-\n mulations that are relatively minor variations in how to\n describe the claims for both Step 1 and Step 2 purposes.\n The error here is far more basic, and more consequential\n for the conduct of a sound analysis. The district court es-\n sentially disregarded limitations, in at least some of the\n patent claims at issue, that are part of the focus of the as-\n serted advances. Because the court overgeneralized, or\n oversimplified, the claims in that fundamental way, the\n court in effect failed to conduct the inquiries required un-\n der the branch of § 101 doctrine relevant here.\n      The § 101 inquiries demand close attention to the spe-\n cific content of the patent claims at issue; the specifics mat-\n ter under the growing body of precedents that provide both\n significant analytical distinctions and fact-specific judg-\n ments important to the assessment of later-litigated facts.\n At least since Alice was decided, it has become clear that\n sometimes those inquiries lead quickly, and without the\n need for extensive discussion, to a conclusion that a claim,\n despite its length, is merely elaborating on what are all ab-\n stract ideas or reciting the details of what are conventional\n tools of implementation. See, e.g., Electric Power Group,\n LLC v. Alstrom S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(Fed. Cir. 2016). But\n the present cases are in a more challenging category, be-\n cause the claims, on their face and understood in light of\n the specifications, purport to solve engineering problems in\n the transfer of data. Whatever conclusion is ultimately\n reached for the claims before us, these cases require a\n sounder starting point, and a more extensive analysis, than\n the district court provided.\n      In these cases, I agree that it is appropriate to take\n what is, and should remain, the unusual step of remanding\n for reconsideration of the § 101 issue without ruling on the\n\fCase: 19-2198    Document: 80      Page: 19     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n REALTIME DATA LLC   v.

Aspects of the case have been before this court\n three times already. The present appeal involves Adobe\n only and several rulings of the district court, of which two\n are central. Specifically, before trial, in response to a mo-\n tion in limine by Adobe, the court excluded all evidence of\n induced infringement from March 3, 2011, through the ex-\n piration of the patents at issue in October 2013. Earlier,\n the court had rejected Adobe’s challenge to the asserted\n claims as ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n     A jury found for TecSec on direct infringement, but not\n induced infringement; rejected Adobe’s prior-art validity\n challenges; and awarded damages. The district court,\n though generally denying Adobe’s post-trial motions, re-\n duced the damages award to zero on the ground that there\n was no proof of any damages from direct infringement and\n the jury had rejected induced infringement.\n     TecSec appeals. It challenges the district court’s mo-\n tion-in-limine ruling, as well as certain jury instructions\n and the post-trial damages reduction. Adobe cross-ap-\n peals, challenging the district court’s ruling on eligibility.\n We reverse the evidentiary ruling that eliminated TecSec’s\n inducement case for a substantial period, and we reject\n Adobe’s challenge to the district court’s eligibility ruling.\n For those reasons, and others stated in this opinion, we\n\fCase: 19-2192       Document: 60     Page: 3     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                                    3\n\n\n\n reverse the judgment in part and remand for further pro-\n ceedings on TecSec’s claim of induced infringement.\n                                 I\n                                 A\n      TecSec owns U.S. Patent Nos. 5,369,702, 5,680,452,\n 5,717,755, and 5,898,781, the patents asserted in this case.\n The patents are entitled “Distributed Cryptographic Object\n Method” (the “DCOM patents”) and claim particular sys-\n tems and methods for multi-level security of various kinds\n of files being transmitted in a data network. See ’702 pa-\n tent, col. 3, lines 12–24; id., col. 12, lines 2–16; id., col. 12,\n line 45, through col. 13, line 20. In particular, the DCOM\n patents describe a method in which a digital object—e.g., a\n document, video, or spreadsheet—is assigned a level of se-\n curity that corresponds to a certain combination of access\n controls and encryption. Id., col. 3, line 58, through col. 4,\n line 2; id., col. 4, lines 18–25; id., col. 5, lines 42–51. The\n encrypted object can then be embedded or “nested” within\n a “container object,” which, if itself encrypted and access-\n controlled, provides a second layer of security. Id., col. 4,\n lines 25–34.\n     Claims 1 and 8 of the ’702 patent are representative of\n the asserted claims. Claim 1 recites:\n         1. A method for providing multi-level multime-\n     dia security in a data network, comprising the\n     steps of:\n         A) accessing an object-oriented key manager;\n         B) selecting an object to encrypt;\n         C) selecting a label for the object;\n         D) selecting an encryption algorithm;\n         E) encrypting the object according to the en-\n           cryption algorithm;\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 4    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                  TECSEC, INC.   v.

Whereas the subject of\n claim 1 is a method, the subject of claim 8 is a system that\n includes components—a “system memory,” “an encryption\n algorithm module,” “an object labelling subsystem,” “a de-\n cryption algorithm module,” and “an object label identifica-\n tion subsystem”—that carry out the steps of claim 1’s\n method. Id., col. 12, line 45, through col. 13, line 19.\n                              B\n     In 2010, TecSec filed a complaint alleging infringement\n of the DCOM patents by Adobe, International Business\n Machines Corp. (IBM), and several other companies. On\n March 3, 2011, after staying the case as to all defendants\n except IBM, the district court construed several claim\n terms of the DCOM patents, including the term “multime-\n dia.” Based on those constructions, the district court\n granted IBM summary judgment of noninfringement. In\n January 2012, we summarily affirmed that noninfringe-\n ment judgment without reaching certain issues, including\n the construction of “multimedia.” TecSec, Inc. v. Int’l Busi-\n ness Machines Corp., 466 F. App’x 882 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n      The case then proceeded in district court against Adobe\n and other defendants. As relevant here, on April 23, 2012,\n TecSec and Adobe stipulated that, under the claim con-\n struction already adopted (which TecSec reserved the right\n to appeal), TecSec could not show that Adobe or the users\n of its accused Acrobat products infringed the DCOM pa-\n tents, as alleged, through their actions involving portable\n document format documents (PDFs). The next day, the\n\fCase: 19-2192       Document: 60   Page: 5    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               5\n\n\n\n district court entered a judgment of noninfringement for\n Adobe. On October 2, 2013, we reversed the district court’s\n construction of “multimedia” and remanded for further pro-\n ceedings under the correct construction. TecSec, Inc. v.\n Int’l Business Machines Corp., 731 F.3d 1336, 1345–49\n (Fed. Cir. 2013) (TecSec I), cert. denied sub nom. Cisco Sys-\n tems, Inc. v. TecSec, Inc., 572 U.S. 1158 (2014).\n      The DCOM patents expired on October 18, 2013,\n shortly after our TecSec I ruling. In October 2014, Adobe\n filed a motion for summary judgment of noninfringement,\n J.A. 165, and the district court granted the motion in May\n 2015, J.A. 27086–127. In August 2016, citing genuine dis-\n putes over material facts, we reversed that judgment and\n again remanded to the district court. TecSec, Inc. v. Adobe\n Systems Inc., 658 F. App’x 570 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (TecSec II).\n     The case returned to the district court. In March 2017,\n Adobe moved for summary judgment of ineligibility under\n § 101. J.A. 1841–71. The district court, noting that the\n parties agreed that claims 1 and 8 of the ’702 patent were\n representative for § 101 purposes, J.A. 4, denied the motion\n in May 2017. J.A. 3–13. In its ruling, the court stated that\n its rationale actually warranted “judgment in favor of\n [TecSec]” on Adobe’s ineligibility challenge. J.A. 8.\n     In April 2018, after additional discovery, Adobe filed\n another motion for summary judgment of noninfringe-\n ment, making at least one argument for lack of provable\n inducement of infringement. See ECF 1054 (motion); ECF\n 1123 at 10–11 (reply supporting motion). The district court\n denied the motion in June 2018. J.A. 10298–99. In August\n 2018, Adobe stipulated that “on at least one occasion,”\n “there was direct infringement of the asserted claims” by\n an Adobe employee. J.A. 10307–08. It is common ground\n on appeal that this stipulation was referring to an occasion\n when an Adobe employee performed the steps of the\n method claims using an accused version of Adobe’s Acrobat\n product, reflected in a February 2009 blog post on\n\fCase: 19-2192     Document: 60     Page: 6    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                   TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n “packaging options for encrypted PDFs” that he wrote for\n an Adobe users’ forum. See J.A. 24459–60.\n     In October 2018, as trial was approaching, Adobe filed\n an omnibus motion in limine, the first heading of which\n asked the court to “preclude argument, evidence, or testi-\n mony on Adobe’s intent to induce or willfully infringe be-\n tween March 3, 2011 and October 18, 2013, unless TecSec\n concedes admissibility of the March 3, 2011 Order (DX-28),\n Stipulation of Non-infringement (DX-29), and Judgment\n (DX-30).” J.A. 10429. Adobe argued that a “judgment or\n stipulation of non-infringement is highly relevant to an ac-\n cused infringer’s state of mind.” Id. “If TecSec argues that\n Adobe had specific intent to induce infringement or will-\n fully infringe during this period,” Adobe stated, “TecSec\n opens the door to the admissibility of this exculpatory evi-\n dence”—which, Adobe asserted (without citing evidence), it\n reasonably relied on, so that “there can be no specific intent\n to induce infringement during [the] roughly 31-month pe-\n riod” from March 2011 to October 2013. Id. TecSec argued\n that intent was a fact question for the jury, and it disagreed\n with Adobe’s submission that allowing proof of inducement\n during the period at issue required admission of the three\n documents. J.A. 10849. TecSec did not indicate that it\n would decline to proceed with its inducement case for the\n period at issue if that evidence was to be admitted.\n     At an oral argument on the omnibus motion on Friday,\n November 9, 2018, the district court indicated that it in-\n tended to preclude “any reference” to Adobe’s post-March\n 2011 conduct, making admission of the three documents\n immaterial. ECF 1294, p. 35; id. at pp. 3–4, 34–37. The\n court stated its intent in that respect equally for the in-\n ducement contention and the willfulness contention. Id.\n On November 13, 2018, after the Veterans Day weekend\n but before any ruling by the court, TecSec filed a supple-\n mental brief stating expressly that even if the district court\n allowed Adobe to present evidence of Adobe’s lack of intent,\n “the Court should not preclude TecSec from presenting\n\fCase: 19-2192       Document: 60   Page: 7    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               7\n\n\n\n evidence on Adobe’s intent to induce infringement.”\n TecSec, Inc.’s Suppl. Br. Regarding Def. Adobe Inc.’s Mot.\n in Limine #1 at 7, TecSec, Inc. v. Adobe, Inc., No. 1:10-cv-\n 00115-LO-TCB (E.D. Va. Nov. 13, 2018), ECF 1283-1\n (TecSec’s Supp. MIL Br.). The district court, TecSec ar-\n gued, could not “resolve a substantive factual dispute\n through a limine ruling before the evidence is presented at\n trial.” Id.\n      On November 21, 2018, the district court granted\n Adobe’s motion and excluded all evidence of induced in-\n fringement after March 3, 2011. J.A. 26–29. The court\n based its decision on what Adobe treats as two independent\n grounds. First, the court held that, after the favorable\n 2011 claim construction, which was reasonable even\n though it was later reversed, it was impossible as a matter\n of law for Adobe to have had the requisite intent to induce\n third-party infringement. J.A. 27. Second, the court stated\n that, while allowing TecSec to argue inducement of in-\n fringement without permitting Adobe to introduce the\n three documents at issue would highly prejudice Adobe, ad-\n mitting that evidence would be prejudicial to TecSec and\n confuse the jury. J.A. 28–29. The court therefore barred\n the presentation of all inducement evidence concerning the\n period after March 3, 2011. Id.\n     The case proceeded to a jury trial, which began on De-\n cember 10, 2018. 1 On December 12, 2018, TecSec stipu-\n lated that, because it had failed to mark its product in\n accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 287, it would not seek damages\n for any infringement that took place before the filing of its\n complaint. J.A. 11998. Accordingly, the trial was limited\n\n\n     1    By December 9, 2018, the only patent claims at is-\n sue were the ’702 patent’s claims 1 and 8; the ’755 patent’s\n claim 1; the ’781 patent’s claims 1 and 14; and the ’452 pa-\n tent’s claim 1. J.A. 11994. Several additional claims had\n been at issue at the time of the § 101 ruling. J.A. 1845.\n\fCase: 19-2192     Document: 60     Page: 8    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                   TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n to TecSec’s ownership of the patents; direct infringement\n by Adobe from February 2010 to October 2013; induced in-\n fringement by Adobe from February 2010 to March 3, 2011;\n Adobe’s anticipation and obviousness challenges; and dam-\n ages. See J.A. 38–44.\n     At trial, TecSec offered the deposition testimony of\n George Johnson, an independent technology consultant, as\n evidence of direct infringement by third parties allegedly\n induced by Adobe. Mr. Johnson had stated that, in April\n 2011, he provided Acrobat users with guidance on how to\n use certain features. The court excluded certain parts of\n Mr. Johnson’s testimony, stating that the period for induce-\n ment ended on March 3, 2011, and that TecSec could not\n submit evidence of later conduct. J.A. 12429–30.\n     At the conclusion of trial, the court gave the jury two\n instructions relevant to this appeal. Jury Instruction No.\n 25 highlighted Adobe’s stipulation that the 2009 employee\n blog post constituted direct infringement, and it noted that\n this act had occurred before TecSec filed its complaint in\n 2010. J.A. 12076; see J.A. 10307–08. Jury Instruction No.\n 28 stated that “mere inaction, or a failure to stop or prevent\n infringement, does not constitute inducement.” J.A. 12079.\n     On December 19, 2018, the jury, besides confirming\n TecSec’s ownership of the patents, J.A. 39, found that\n Adobe had directly infringed all asserted claims, but that\n Adobe had not committed inducement of infringement, J.A.\n 40–41. The jury also found that Adobe had failed to estab-\n lish that the asserted claims were invalid under the prior\n art. J.A. 42–43. The jury awarded TecSec $1.75 million in\n damages. J.A. 44.\n     The district court then ruled on Adobe’s post-trial mo-\n tion. It declined to disturb the verdicts on direct infringe-\n ment and invalidity, J.A. 53–55, but it vacated the jury’s\n damages award and set damages to zero, J.A. 55–60. The\n court explained that TecSec’s only evidence of damages re-\n lated to sales of Acrobat software to customers and that\n\fCase: 19-2192       Document: 60     Page: 9   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                                9\n\n\n\n such evidence could support damages only for inducing in-\n fringement—which the jury found had not occurred. Id.\n     The district court thereafter entered a final judgment\n as to Adobe under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). J.A. 2. TecSec\n timely appealed, and Adobe timely cross-appealed. We\n have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(1).\n                                II\n     In general, we apply regional-circuit law to evidentiary\n determinations and jury instructions. Barry v. Medtronic,\n Inc., 914 F.3d 1310, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019). The Fourth Cir-\n cuit reviews both types of rulings for an abuse of discretion.\n See Campbell v. Boston Sci. Corp., 882 F.3d 70, 77 (4th Cir.\n 2018) (evidentiary determinations); Chaudhry v. Galler-\n izzo, 174 F.3d 394, 408 (4th Cir. 1999) (jury instructions).\n But “where a district court rules, as a matter of patent law,\n that a party is precluded from introducing evidence, we ap-\n ply Federal Circuit law and review the district court’s rul-\n ing de novo.” Sulzer Textil A.G. v. Picanol N.V., 358 F.3d\n 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2004). We review de novo a jury in-\n struction that concerns patent law. Bettcher Indus., Inc. v.\n Bunzl USA, Inc., 661 F.3d 629, 638 (Fed. Cir. 2011). We\n review a judgment as a matter of law de novo. Barry, 914\n F.3d at 1320; Huskey v. Ethicon, Inc., 848 F.3d 151, 156\n (4th Cir. 2017). Whether a patent claim is eligible for pa-\n tenting under 35 U.S.C. § 101 is a question of law, to which\n underlying facts may be relevant. Berkheimer v. HP Inc.,\n 881 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2018).\n                                A\n      We begin with TecSec’s appeals of the district court’s\n motion-in-limine ruling and the court’s related exclusion of\n Mr. Johnson’s deposition testimony. We reverse the dis-\n trict court’s decision to exclude evidence of inducement of\n infringement after March 3, 2011, and the related exclu-\n sion of Mr. Johnson’s testimony. We remand for further\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 10    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                  TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n proceedings on TecSec’s inducement claim as to the period\n after March 3, 2011.\n      The district court set forth two reasons for ruling that\n there could be no proof of post-March 3, 2011 inducement\n of infringement. First, the district court explained that the\n March 3, 2011 claim construction and stipulation of nonin-\n fringement made it legally impossible for Adobe to have\n had, after that date, the knowledge—of the infringing char-\n acter of the allegedly induced customer actions—required\n for inducement. J.A. 27–28. Because such knowledge was\n legally precluded, the district court reasoned, Adobe could\n not be liable for induced infringement. Id. Second, the dis-\n trict court stated that allowing either party to present evi-\n dence would substantially prejudice the other party and\n would confuse the jury. J.A. 28–29. We reject both ration-\n ales for the motion-in-limine ruling.\n                               1\n     A defendant is liable for “induced infringement under\n § 271(b)” if the defendant took certain affirmative acts to\n bring about the commission by others of acts of infringe-\n ment and had “knowledge that the induced acts constitute\n patent infringement.” Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB\n S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 765–66 (2011); see Commil USA, LLC\n v. Cisco Systems, Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1920, 1928 (2015); Power\n Integrations, Inc. v. Fairchild Semiconductor Int’l, Inc., 843\n F.3d 1315, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The intent element re-\n quires “knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent\n infringement,” which can be established by a proper find-\n ing of “willful blindness.” Global-Tech, 563 U.S. at 766–71;\n see Commil, 135 S. Ct. at 1926–28 (reiterating requirement\n of knowledge of infringing character of induced conduct,\n not just knowledge of patent). This intent element was the\n basis for the district court’s primary rationale for its mo-\n tion-in-limine ruling, a ruling that assumed that the in-\n duced conduct was in fact infringing.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60   Page: 11    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                              11\n\n\n\n      The intent standard focuses on, and can be met by proof\n of, the defendant’s subjective state of mind, whether actual\n knowledge or the subjective beliefs (coupled with action to\n avoid learning more) that characterizes willful blindness.\n Global-Tech, 563 U.S. at 769. As a logical matter, a defend-\n ant may have the liability-supporting subjective state of\n mind even if a person could believe, with objective reason-\n ableness (though wrongly), that the induced conduct was\n not infringing. To make the point in terms of this case,\n Adobe may have had the requisite knowledge of infringe-\n ment if it believed (as we ultimately held in 2013) that the\n March 3, 2011 claim construction was incorrect, even if\n that construction was objectively reasonable.\n     We have so ruled as to willfulness—an issue that\n Adobe, in its motion, and the district court, in its ruling,\n treated together with inducement. Specifically, we have\n held that, under Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics,\n Inc., 136 S. Ct. 1923, 1933 (2016), a finding of willfulness\n may rest on the subjective bad faith of the infringer even if\n it would be objectively reasonable to view the conduct at\n issue as non-infringing. WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophys-\n ical Corp., 837 F.3d 1358, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2016), reinstated\n 913 F.3d 1067, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 2019). That logic applies\n equally to the intent element of inducement, as we con-\n cluded in our non-precedential decision in Smith & Nephew\n Inc. v. Arthrex, Inc., 603 F. App’x 981 (Fed Cir. 2015),\n where we explained that a district court’s prior judgment\n of noninfringement, and statement to the parties that the\n plaintiff’s inducement claim was objectively weak, did not\n prevent the plaintiff, as a matter of law, from proving the\n subjective intent element of induced infringement, which\n is a fact issue. Id. at 989–90; see also Sanofi v. Watson\n Labs. Inc., 875 F.3d 636, 645 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (factual is-\n sue); AstraZeneca LP v. Apotex, Inc., 633 F.3d 1042, 1056,\n 1059–60 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (same).\n      The Supreme Court’s conclusion about subjective be-\n liefs and legal reasonableness in another context supports\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 12    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                                  TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n this conclusion. In Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192\n (1991), the Court reviewed the conviction of a taxpayer\n charged with willful failure to pay taxes, which requires\n “knowing” that the law required the payment not made. Id.\n at 194 n.2, 199–201. The Court held that, even though it\n would be not just incorrect but unreasonable as a matter of\n law for the taxpayer to believe that the statute did not re-\n quire payment, the jury had to be permitted to decide\n whether the taxpayer in good faith believed the incorrect,\n legally unreasonable view that no tax was due. Id. at 202–\n 04. Thus, the legally material question of what the defend-\n ant subjectively believed was not answered as a matter of\n law even by the objective unreasonableness of that belief.\n Likewise, the question whether the defendant subjectively\n had what turned out to be the correct belief (here, that\n Adobe believed that the claims meant what we eventually\n held in 2013) is not answered as a matter of law by the ob-\n jective reasonableness of a contrary belief.\n     The district court in this case erred when it concluded\n as a matter of law that, after the district court’s (later re-\n versed) claim construction on March 3, 2011, Adobe “lacked\n the requisite intent to induce infringement.” J.A. 27. The\n court explained that it had “reasonably, though errone-\n ously, ruled in Adobe’s favor on infringement,” and, accord-\n ingly, Adobe was entitled to rely on that ruling as proof\n that the relevant induced acts were non-infringing. Id.\n That reasoning makes dispositive what Adobe, with objec-\n tive reasonableness, could have believed. The Global-Tech\n inducement standard, however, can be met by proof of what\n Adobe in fact subjectively believed. For example, Adobe\n might have believed that the March 2011 claim-construc-\n tion ruling was erroneous (though reasonable) and would\n likely be reversed (as it was in 2013). Thus, the district\n court’s March 2011 ruling “could, at most, create a factual\n question, not an entitlement to a no-knowledge finding as\n a matter of law.” Smith & Nephew, 603 F. App’x at 989–\n 90.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 13   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               13\n\n\n\n     For those reasons, we conclude that the district court\n legally erred in its primary rationale for ruling out induce-\n ment after March 3, 2011, namely, that the claim-construc-\n tion ruling of that date furnished an objectively reasonable\n basis for a belief that use of the accused products did not\n infringe, even if Adobe did not have such a belief.\n                                2\n     The district court’s second ground for its motion-in-\n limine ruling was that “allowing TecSec to argue [post-\n March 3, 2011] induced or willful infringement . . . would\n taint the trial and any verdict with undue prejudice and\n juror confusion.” J.A. 28. Whether we review that ruling\n de novo or for an abuse of discretion, we conclude that the\n district court erred in relying on this rationale to preclude\n TecSec from proving inducement after March 3, 2011.\n      In defending the district court’s rationale, Adobe in-\n vokes Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which pro-\n vides that a court “may exclude relevant evidence if its\n probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger\n of,” among other factors, “unfair prejudice” or “confusing\n the issues.” But the district court in this case went beyond\n excluding a single piece, or even a fixed set, of evidence and\n leaving TecSec to present such other relevant, admissible\n evidence as it may have on inducement in the period at is-\n sue. Instead, the court foreclosed the introduction of any\n evidence on the issue of post-March 3, 2011 inducement of\n infringement. This is materially different from any appli-\n cation of Rule 403 Adobe has identified. Cf. General Dy-\n namics Corp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 484–85 (2011)\n (distinguishing case involving “purely evidentiary dispute”\n over state-secret privilege, where “the privileged infor-\n mation is excluded and the trial goes on without it,” from\n case involving foreclosure of a claim).\n     The district court reasoned that if TecSec was allowed\n to argue inducement of infringement after that date, Adobe\n would be prejudiced were it not allowed to introduce the\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60     Page: 14    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14                                 TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n March 3, 2011 claim construction and the stipulation by\n TecSec that, under that construction, Adobe’s customers\n did not directly infringe. J.A. 28. The court then concluded\n that “it would also be substantially and unduly prejudicial\n and confusing for the jury to see a prior ruling in this case\n and TecSec’s stipulation that Adobe’s products did not in-\n fringe.” J.A. 28–29. On that basis, the district court pre-\n cluded TecSec from offering any proof of post-March 3,\n 2011 inducement.\n     Adobe has not cited any authority that supports such\n foreclosure of liability for a given period in the circum-\n stances present here. Any conclusion that post-March 3,\n 2011 inducement could not be fairly tried would have re-\n quired consideration of what other admissible evidence\n TecSec had that was relevant to the intent element of in-\n ducement, as well as of the possible measures for effec-\n tively but fairly reducing jury confusion. But the district\n court did not undertake, and because of the limited scope\n of Adobe’s motion in limine was in no position to undertake,\n that required consideration.\n      Adobe’s motion, besides what it suggested on the legal-\n impossibility point, was limited to arguing for Adobe’s abil-\n ity to introduce the claim-construction ruling and TecSec’s\n stipulation. It did not call for TecSec to identify all evi-\n dence of intent—as a motion for summary judgment would\n have done—so that the district court could determine if\n there was a triable issue of post-March 3, 2011 inducement\n of infringement. See J.A. 10429. TecSec therefore properly\n limited its response to arguing against the admission of the\n construction and stipulation. See J.A. 10849. On the mo-\n tion as framed, the district court lacked the basis to con-\n sider the totality of TecSec’s post-March 3, 2011\n inducement evidence to determine whether that issue\n could fairly be tried. And the court did not consider the\n totality of such evidence. Nor, in taking the extraordinary\n action of foreclosing liability for a substantial period, did\n the district court set forth an analysis of potential means,\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60    Page: 15    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               15\n\n\n\n such as cautionary jury instructions, that could reduce jury\n confusion and allow a fair trial considering the totality of\n relevant evidence.\n     Adobe cites several cases to support the proposition\n that “there are circumstances where, for willfulness or in-\n equitable conduct, there can be no intent as a matter of\n law.” Appellant’s Br. at 28. None of those cases support\n the ruling in this case. The cited cases all involved ordi-\n nary motions for summary judgment that, with proper pro-\n cedural protections, duly enabled the court to consider all\n evidence relevant to the particular liability issue. See Fer-\n ring B.V. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 437 F.3d 1181, 1190–94 (Fed.\n Cir. 2006) (finding lack of intent for inequitable conduct af-\n ter consideration of evidence on summary judgment); In-\n tercontinental Great Brands LLC v. Kellogg N. America\n Co., 869 F.3d 1336, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (same). By con-\n trast, Adobe’s motion in limine did not call for, or provide a\n basis for, consideration of all relevant material evidence.\n Without such consideration, the district court could not\n properly resolve the issue as a matter of law. 2\n      As Adobe acknowledges in this court, see Cross-Appel-\n lant’s Principal and Response Br. at 15, 20, when the dis-\n trict court stated that it would be “substantially and\n unduly prejudicial and confusing for the jury to see” the\n claim-construction ruling and TecSec’s stipulation, J.A.\n 28–29, the court was determining that the evidence Adobe\n was entitled to introduce would be “unduly prejudicial” to\n TecSec. But TecSec never stated that, if that evidence had\n to be admitted at Adobe’s behest, TecSec would drop its in-\n ducement claim for the post-March 3, 2011 period. To the\n\n\n     2    Adobe has not argued in its briefing in this court\n that any error in the motion-in-limine ruling was harmless\n because TecSec lacked sufficient evidence of intent to cre-\n ate a triable issue. See Cross-Appellant’s Principal and Re-\n sponse Br. at 19–34.\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60     Page: 16    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16                                TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n contrary, after the district court opined at the oral argu-\n ment that admitting that evidence would be “far too preju-\n dicial,” ECF 1294 at 36, TecSec reiterated its intent to\n present the inducement case even if that evidence were ad-\n mitted. TecSec’s Supp. MIL Br. (ECF 1283-1) at 7. The\n court furnished no justification for making that determina-\n tion itself instead of leaving to TecSec the determination\n that the prejudice to TecSec was too severe for the issue to\n be tried at all.\n     Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s decision to\n preclude TecSec from introducing evidence of post-March\n 3, 2011 inducement of infringement.\n                              3\n      TecSec’s appeal of the exclusion of certain aspects of\n Mr. Johnson’s deposition testimony is closely tied to the\n motion-in-limine ruling. In the testimony at issue, Mr.\n Johnson stated that, in April 2011, he had posted responses\n on an Adobe forum explaining how to use Acrobat products\n in ways that TecSec alleged were infringing. At trial,\n Adobe objected to the introduction of that testimony, argu-\n ing that the testimony “runs afoul of the Court’s [motion-\n in-limine] ruling on eliciting alleged infringement [post-\n March 3, 2011].” J.A. 12427. The district court agreed with\n Adobe, excluding the testimony because “it’s outside of the\n timeframe and it is clearly inducement evidence.” J.A.\n 12429–30. Because we conclude that the district court\n erred in its motion-in-limine ruling that was the basis for\n the exclusion of the Johnson testimony at issue, we reverse\n that evidentiary exclusion as well.\n                              B\n     TecSec challenges Jury Instruction Nos. 25 and 28. We\n find no reversible error in either instruction, asking\n whether TecSec has “establish[ed] that the instructions\n were legally erroneous and that the errors had a prejudicial\n effect.” Bettcher, 661 F.3d at 638.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 17     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                                  17\n\n\n\n                                1\n      In Jury Instruction No. 25, the district court told the\n jury that Adobe had admitted that a certain sequence of\n steps (“create” a file, “attach” it to a second file, “encrypt”\n the second file, “decrypt” the first file) constituted direct in-\n fringement, that Adobe had admitted that “this occurred on\n at least one occasion, by Adobe itself,” and that the “parties\n agree that the one time for which Adobe has admitted in-\n fringement—that is Adobe’s use in connection with creat-\n ing a February 2009 blog post—occurred before TecSec\n filed its lawsuit in February 2010.” J.A. 12076 (emphases\n added). That instruction mirrors Adobe’s pre-trial stipula-\n tion, differing only in its specific reference to the February\n 2009 blog post. See J.A. 10307.\n     TecSec challenges the district court’s inclusion of the\n reference to the February 2009 blog post, stating that\n “TecSec never agreed that Adobe only admitted to a single\n act of infringement” and that the “instruction is misleading\n because it implies that, in the context of the district court’s\n narrow damages window, Adobe’s 2009 blog is irrelevant.”\n Appellant’s Br. at 43–44. We reject the challenge.\n      TecSec relies on a single piece of evidence as showing a\n broader Adobe admission, namely, Adobe’s stipulation that\n it had “installed for its own internal use at least one copy\n of each version of the accused products on a computer hav-\n ing system memory.” J.A. 11994 (emphasis added). But\n Jury Instruction No. 25 is best understood to tie “the one\n time” language, to which TecSec objects, to what the imme-\n diately preceding two sentences discuss, which is on its face\n performance of a method. Installation, by contrast, could\n constitute infringement only of the system claims. See J.A.\n 12769 (Trial Tr. at 534:4–5). The installation action thus\n is simply outside the scope of, and does not contradict, Jury\n Instruction No. 25—which left TecSec free to argue that\n there were instances of Adobe-admitted infringement of\n the system claims. Moreover, the reference to the timing\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60     Page: 18    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18                                TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n of the blog post is accurate and does not itself imply any-\n thing about the legal relevance of the timing. We therefore\n find no reversible error in Jury Instruction No. 25, without\n foreclosing the district court, in any new trial on induce-\n ment after March 3, 2011, from considering whether the\n instruction should be modified.\n                              2\n     In Jury Instruction No. 28, the district court told the\n jury that inducement of infringement requires “an affirm-\n ative act to encourage infringement” and that “[e]vidence\n of mere inaction, or a failure to stop or prevent infringe-\n ment, does not constitute inducement.” J.A. 12079. That\n language mirrors our statement in Tegal Corp. v. Tokyo\n Electron Co. that “[a]ctively inducing . . . requires an af-\n firmative act of some kind.” 248 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed. Cir.\n 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n     TecSec challenges the instruction on the ground that it\n opened the door for Adobe to imply that TecSec had accused\n Adobe of inaction only. Specifically, TecSec argues, Adobe\n “exploited the improper instruction during closing” argu-\n ments when Adobe characterized its failure to remove the\n 2009 blog post as mere inaction. Appellant’s Br. at 45; see\n J.A. 13544. We reject this challenge.\n     TecSec does not contest the accuracy of Jury Instruc-\n tion No. 28 as a statement of the law, and it has not shown\n that instruction was misleading. TecSec believes that\n Adobe’s conduct to have been more than mere inaction, but\n the instruction left TecSec free to so argue. As for Adobe’s\n closing argument, TecSec forfeited a challenge to the argu-\n ment by failing to object contemporaneously. See United\n States v. Cone, 714 F.3d 197, 217 (4th Cir. 2013).\n                              C\n     TecSec challenges the district court’s reduction of the\n jury’s damages award to zero. We reject this challenge.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60   Page: 19   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                             19\n\n\n\n     TecSec argues that because the jury found direct in-\n fringement of each asserted claim, 35 U.S.C. § 284 entitles\n TecSec to a non-zero reasonable royalty. Specifically,\n TecSec highlights § 284’s statements that “[u]pon finding\n for the claimant the court shall award the claimant dam-\n ages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in\n no event less than a reasonable royalty” and that “[w]hen\n the damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess\n them.” 35 U.S.C. § 284. Taken together, TecSec contends,\n those statements require an award of damages greater\n than zero in all cases where the jury finds infringement.\n     The statute does not require an award of damages if\n none are proven that adequately tie a dollar amount to the\n infringing acts. We have explained that “a patent owner\n may waive its right to a damages award when it deliber-\n ately abandons valid theories of recovery in a singular pur-\n suit of an ultimately invalid damages theory.” Promega\n Corp. v. Life Techs. Corp., 875 F.3d 651, 666 (Fed. Cir.\n 2017). More generally, we have observed that there can be\n an award of no damages where “none were proven.” Gus-\n tafson, Inc. v. Intersystems Indus. Prods., Inc., 897 F.2d\n 508, 509–10 (Fed. Cir. 1990); cf. Gadsden Indus. Park, LLC\n v. United States, 956 F.3d 1362, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (Tak-\n ings Clause does not require an award of compensation\n without adequate proof). Although we have not upheld a\n zero royalty rate in a case with an affirmative infringement\n finding—and have stated that it is “unlikely” that a hypo-\n thetical negotiation would result in a zero royalty rate—we\n have previously stated that “in a case completely lacking\n any evidence on which to base a damages award, the record\n may well support a zero royalty award.” Apple, Inc v.\n Motorola, Inc., 757 F.3d 1286, 1328 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n     In this case, TecSec presented no evidence of damages\n caused by Adobe’s direct infringement, which was the only\n form of infringement that the jury found Adobe to have\n committed. J.A. 58. TecSec did not, for example, provide\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60       Page: 20   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 20                                  TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n any evidence regarding the number of Adobe employees in\n the United States or the number of times that Adobe em-\n ployees installed Acrobat. Id. TecSec’s only damages evi-\n dence relied on “sales of accused products.” E.g., J.A.\n 12840, 12842–44, 12854–56, 12866; see also J.A. 13499–\n 500 (TecSec’s closing argument, stating, “all that TecSec is\n asking for here, a reasonable royalty based on [Adobe’s]\n sales of Acrobat products”). But the district court found,\n and TecSec does not dispute, that direct infringement oc-\n curs only after Acrobat is installed. J.A. 57. Sales of Acro-\n bat, therefore, cannot be a measure of damages for direct\n infringement by Adobe—sales could serve here as a meas-\n ure of damages only for TecSec’s indirect infringement the-\n ory, which relies on infringement by Adobe customers. But\n the jury found no indirect infringement.\n     On appeal, TecSec tries to rationalize the jury’s award\n by theorizing ways the jury could have used sales data to\n derive a value for Adobe’s conduct. For instance, TecSec\n argues that the jury could have decided that sales were a\n good proxy for the value of TecSec’s patented invention to\n Adobe’s development of Acrobat. Appellant’s Opening Br.\n at 59–60. But this theory, like the others that TecSec of-\n fers, is ultimately speculative and insufficiently grounded\n in evidence. The district court therefore committed no er-\n ror in concluding that the jury’s damages award was not\n supported by the evidence. J.A. 57–58.\n                              III\n     The district court denied Adobe’s motion for summary\n judgment that the asserted claims are ineligible under 35\n U.S.C. § 101, and in its opinion, the court stated that its\n conclusion required judgment for TecSec rejecting the eli-\n gibility challenge. Adobe now cross-appeals that ruling. It\n does not object to the district court’s turning the denial of\n summary judgment for Adobe into summary judgment for\n TecSec. Adobe thus accepts that the dispositive ruling\n against its eligibility challenge should be judged on the\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 21   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               21\n\n\n\n record made on its motion for summary judgment. We af-\n firm the district court’s § 101 ruling.\n                                A\n      Section 101 provides that “[w]hoever invents or discov-\n ers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or\n composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement\n thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the condi-\n tions and requirements of this title.” 35 U.S.C. § 101. But\n this provision “contains an important implicit exception:\n Laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are\n not patentable.” Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l,\n 573 U.S. 208, 216 (2014). In Alice, the Supreme Court ex-\n plained that a “claim falls outside § 101 where (1) it is ‘di-\n rected to’ a patent-ineligible concept, i.e., a law of nature,\n natural phenomenon, or abstract idea, and (2), if so, the\n particular elements of the claim, considered ‘both individ-\n ually and “as an ordered combination,”’ do not add enough\n to ‘“transform the nature of the claim” into a patent-eligible\n application.’” SAP America, Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC, 898\n F.3d 1161, 1166–67 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing Alice, 573 U.S.\n at 217).\n      We have approached the Step 1 “directed to” inquiry by\n asking “what the patent asserts to be the ‘focus of the\n claimed advance over the prior art.’” Solutran, Inc. v.

Id. In Ancora, we up-\n held claims requiring use of a modifiable portion of\n particular computer capacity to prevent running software\n on an unauthorized computer. 908 F.3d at 1345.

And in Finjan, we held\n to be eligible claims directed to a specific “behavior-based\n virus scan” that provided a “flexible and nuanced virus fil-\n tering” to help solve the problem of security on networked\n computers. 879 F.3d at 1304–05.\n      Other illustrative cases lie on the ineligibility side of\n the line. In Ericsson, we held to be ineligible claims de-\n scribing “a system and method for controlling access to a\n platform for a mobile terminal for a wireless telecommuni-\n cations system.” 955 F.3d at 1325–26. The claims, we ex-\n plained, “merely make generic functional recitations that\n requests are made and then granted.” Id. at 1328. In In-\n tellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp., we held ineli-\n gible claims directed to using computers to screen\n telephone calls for viruses. 838 F.3d 1307, 1319 (Fed. Cir.\n 2016). The claims did not “claim a new method of virus\n screening or improvements thereto” and merely claimed\n use of conventional virus-screening software to carry out\n the abstract virus-screening idea. Id. And in RecogniCorp,\n LLC v. Nintendo Co., we held that claims to encoding and\n decoding image data were ineligible. 855 F.3d 1322, 1326\n (Fed. Cir. 2017). The claims did nothing more than use\n computers to perform standard encoding and decoding\n practices. Id. at 1326–27.\n     The Step 1 “directed to” analysis called for by our cases\n depends on an accurate characterization of what the claims\n require and of what the patent asserts to be the claimed\n advance. The accuracy of those characterizations is crucial\n to the sound conduct of the inquiries into the problem being\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 25   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               25\n\n\n\n addressed and whether the line of specificity of solution has\n been crossed.\n                                B\n     Adobe argued to the district court that “the claims are\n directed to the impermissibly abstract idea of managing ac-\n cess to objects using multiple levels of encryption.” J.A.\n 1845; see J.A. 1857 (heading: “The Asserted Claims of the\n DCOM Patents Are Directed to the Impermissibly Abstract\n Idea of Managing Access to Objects Using Multiple Levels\n of Encryption”); id. (“The asserted claims of the DCOM pa-\n tents are directed to the abstract idea of managing access\n to objects using multiple levels of encryption, and fail to\n provide any specific solution for accomplishing that\n claimed result.”). But that characterization of the two rep-\n resentative claims is materially inaccurate. To arrive at it,\n Adobe had to disregard elements of the claims at issue that\n the specification makes clear are important parts of the\n claimed advance in the combination of elements.\n     It suffices to discuss claim 1. 3 Adobe’s characterization\n of what claim 1 as a whole is directed to does not go beyond\n what is required simply by the claim term “multi-level . . .\n security,” which means “‘security achieved when encrypted\n objects are nested within other objects which are also en-\n crypted, possibly within other objects, resulting in multiple\n layers of encryption.’” J.A. 1853 (Adobe’s motion quoting\n construction) (citing TecSec I, 731 F.3d at 1345). But claim\n\n\n\n     3   Adobe has stated that system claim 8, the other\n representative claim, merely claims a system for perform-\n ing the functions recited in method claim 1 and is not rele-\n vantly different from claim 1 in substance for § 101\n purposes. Principal and Response Br. of Cross-Appellant\n at 62, 65. Adobe has not argued, even as a fallback posi-\n tion, that the two claims could call for different § 101 re-\n sults.\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 26     Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 26                                  TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n 1 requires more. It goes beyond managing access to objects\n using multiple levels of encryption, as required by “multi-\n level . . . security.” Notably, it expressly requires, as well,\n accessing an “object-oriented key manager” and specified\n uses of a “label” as well as encryption for the access man-\n agement. ’702 patent, col. 12, lines 4–16. To disregard\n those express claim elements is to proceed at “a high level\n of abstraction” that is “untethered from the claim lan-\n guage” and that “overgeneraliz[es] the claim.” Enfish, 822\n F.3d at 1337; see id. at 1338.\n      As to the key-manager requirement, we explained in\n TecSec II that the requirement was important during pros-\n ecution. Specifically, rather than deleting the claim limi-\n tation after an indefiniteness rejection, TecSec amended\n the specification to provide the required clarity by adding\n what now appears at ’702 patent, col. 1, line 61, to col. 2,\n line 4, which provided the definition that this court even-\n tually relied on in construing “object-oriented key man-\n ager.” TecSec II, 658 F. App’x at 582 (construing the term\n as “a software component that manages the encryption of\n an object by performing one or more of the functions of gen-\n erating, distributing, changing, replacing, storing, check-\n ing on, and destroying cryptographic keys”). As to the\n combination of labeling with the required encryption, the\n specification makes clear that this is part of the focus of the\n claimed advance. The specification expressly identifies a\n deficiency of using only multilevel security through encryp-\n tion requiring keys at more than one level: that approach,\n the specification says, “is quite unwieldy, inflexible, and\n difficult to manage by a security officer or key administra-\n tor.” ’702 patent, col. 2, lines 25–29. The specification then\n explains that it proposes a solution in which “[a] secure\n method of labelling files or messages that are sent from a\n sending user to a receiving user over a network” is used “in\n addition to cryptographic protection.” Id., col. 2, lines 30–\n 33 (emphasis added). Adobe has not shown how it could\n properly disregard these claim requirements in\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60   Page: 27    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                              27\n\n\n\n determining “what the patent asserts to be the focus of the\n claimed advance over the prior art.” Solutran, 931 F.3d at\n 1167–68 (internal quotation marks omitted). The focus of\n the claimed advance cannot ignore all but the multilevel\n encryption.\n      The specification elaborates in a way that simultane-\n ously shows that the claims at issue are directed at solving\n a problem specific to computer data networks. The patent\n focuses on allowing for the simultaneous transmission of\n secure information to a large group of recipients connected\n to a decentralized network—an important feature of data\n networks—but without uniform access to all data by all re-\n cipients. See ’702 patent at col. 11, lines 40–48. The pro-\n posed improvement involves, among other things, labeling\n together with encryption. “Using a secure labelling regi-\n men, a network manager or user can be assured that only\n those messages meant for a certain person, group of per-\n sons, and/or location(s) are in fact received, decrypted, and\n read by the intended receiver.” Id., col. 2, lines 39–43.\n “[M]any people within a company may have the key neces-\n sary to read a data file” that is encrypted and sent to many\n terminals, but the sender may not want all such people to\n read the file. Id., col. 2, lines 45–51. “By employing a se-\n cure labelling technique in addition to encryption, the\n sender can be assured that people having the correct key to\n decrypt the message but working at different terminals\n will not receive or be allowed to access the communication.”\n Id., col. 2, lines 51–55 (emphasis added).\n     In light of what the claim language and specification\n establish, we conclude that the claims are directed to im-\n proving a basic function of a computer data-distribution\n network, namely, network security. See SRI, 930 F.3d at\n 1703; Ancora, 908 F.3d at 1348–49. The patent makes\n clear that the focus of the claimed advance is on improving\n such a data network used for broadcasting a file to a large\n audience, with the improvement assertedly being an effi-\n cient way for the sender to permit different parts of the\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 28    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 28                                  TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n audience to see different parts of the file. ’702 patent, col.\n 2, lines 44–57. While non-computer settings may have se-\n curity issues addressed by multilevel security, it does not\n follow that all patents relating to multilevel security are\n necessarily ineligible for patenting. Here, although the pa-\n tent involves multilevel security, that does not negate the\n conclusion that the patent is aimed at solving a particular\n problem of multicasting computer networks.\n     By way of comparison, in Uniloc, we held the claims at\n issue to be directed to solving a problem of reducing com-\n munication time by using otherwise-unused space in a par-\n ticular protocol-based system, 957 F.3d at 1305, 1307–09,\n even though reducing communication time by using such\n available blank space (or, generally, reducing resource use\n by using otherwise-unused available resources) is a goal in\n many settings. Similarly, in Ancora, we held the claims at\n issue to be directed to solving a problem presented by par-\n ticularly easy unauthorized use of software by placing the\n software in an especially secure computer location, 908\n F.3d at 1349, even though placing items in especially se-\n cure locations to prevent unauthorized access is a goal in\n many settings. The patent claims at issue here are directed\n to improving a data network’s basic functioning by ena-\n bling secure and efficient transmission to intended recipi-\n ents when use is made of the basic multicasting\n functionality of such a data network. As the district court\n said, the claims address the data-network problem pre-\n sented by “multiple users in multiple locations accessing\n information at different security levels from a central re-\n pository.” J.A. 10.\n     A second inquiry significant in our case law remains—\n whether the claims provide a “specific” solution in the way\n our cases discuss. For similar reasons to those mentioned\n above, Adobe has not persuaded us that the claims fail to\n do so, because its arguments ignore what plainly are im-\n portant aspects of the claims and the focus of the claimed\n advance in the combination. See, e.g., J.A. 1857 (arguing\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 29   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                              29\n\n\n\n that the “asserted claims of the DCOM patents are directed\n to the abstract idea of managing access to objects using\n multiple levels of encryption, and fail to provide any spe-\n cific solution for accomplishing that claimed result”).\n     In these circumstances, we conclude that the district\n court correctly rejected Adobe’s ineligibility challenge as\n Adobe presented it to that court.\n                                C\n      On appeal, Adobe seeks to modify its definition of what\n the asserted claims are directed to, now contending that\n “[t]he representative claims are directed to the abstract\n idea of managing access to objects using multiple layers of\n encryption and labels.” Cross-Appellant Principal and Re-\n sponse Br. at 61 (emphasis added). This is a new formula-\n tion on appeal. Adobe cites J.A. 1853 and 1857 following\n the just-quoted sentence, but neither those pages nor any\n others in Adobe’s summary-judgment motion identify the\n encryption/labeling combination as the abstract idea to\n which the claims are directed. As recited above, Adobe\n omitted labeling—as well as the object-oriented key man-\n ager—from its characterization of the purported abstract\n idea in the district court.\n      For the reasons we have set forth, Adobe’s change in its\n “articulation of the purported abstract idea” is substan-\n tively significant. Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. v. LG\n Electronics, Inc., 880 F.3d 1356, 1362 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2018)\n (declining to decide waiver where the appellant’s “articula-\n tion of the purported abstract idea was advanced for the\n first time on appeal”). Adobe’s analysis on appeal is still\n deficient.\n     When Adobe discusses what is now in its formulation\n of the asserted abstract idea, it does not meaningfully ad-\n dress the combination. Rather, it asserts the “common-\n place” character of the individual component techniques\n generally, see Cross-Appellant Principal and Response Br.\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 30   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 30                                 TECSEC, INC.   v.

But that approach is insufficient where,\n as is true here for the reasons we have explained, it is the\n combination of techniques that is “what the patent asserts\n to be the focus of the claimed advance over the prior art.”\n Solutran, 931 F.3d at 1168. Moreover, to the extent, if any,\n that extrinsic evidence is relevant to the summary-judg-\n ment analysis at Step 1, the evidence is one-sided. TecSec\n submitted an expert declaration asserting that the combi-\n nation of techniques we have discussed was a specific, un-\n conventional improvement in computer network\n functionality. J.A. 1960–72; see also J.A. 13 (denying\n Adobe’s motion to strike portions of TecSec’s declaration).\n Adobe has pointed to no evidence of its own that it submit-\n ted in support of its § 101 motion. 4\n     For those reasons, even apart from its departure from\n the theory presented in the district court, the analysis\n Adobe has presented on appeal is insufficient to make the\n showing required for ineligibility.\n                              IV\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n court is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the case\n is remanded for further proceedings on TecSec’s claim of\n inducement of infringement.\n\n\n\n      4  In this court, Adobe has cited a statement con-\n tained in an expert report from its expert, J.A. 7980, but\n TecSec notes, without contradiction from Adobe, that\n Adobe did not present the statement in the summary-judg-\n ment proceedings regarding § 101 eligibility, see Plaintiff-\n Appellant Corrected Response and Reply Brief at 54 n.16.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60   Page: 31   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v.

Aspects of the case have been before this court\n three times already. The present appeal involves Adobe\n only and several rulings of the district court, of which two\n are central. Specifically, before trial, in response to a mo-\n tion in limine by Adobe, the court excluded all evidence of\n induced infringement from March 3, 2011, through the ex-\n piration of the patents at issue in October 2013. Earlier,\n the court had rejected Adobe’s challenge to the asserted\n claims as ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n     A jury found for TecSec on direct infringement, but not\n induced infringement; rejected Adobe’s prior-art validity\n challenges; and awarded damages. The district court,\n though generally denying Adobe’s post-trial motions, re-\n duced the damages award to zero on the ground that there\n was no proof of any damages from direct infringement and\n the jury had rejected induced infringement.\n     TecSec appeals. It challenges the district court’s mo-\n tion-in-limine ruling, as well as certain jury instructions\n and the post-trial damages reduction.

(IBM), and several other companies. On\n March 3, 2011, after staying the case as to all defendants\n except IBM, the district court construed several claim\n terms of the DCOM patents, including the term “multime-\n dia.” Based on those constructions, the district court\n granted IBM summary judgment of noninfringement. In\n January 2012, we summarily affirmed that noninfringe-\n ment judgment without reaching certain issues, including\n the construction of “multimedia.” TecSec, Inc. v.

The district court, noting that the\n parties agreed that claims 1 and 8 of the ’702 patent were\n representative for § 101 purposes, J.A. 4, denied the motion\n in May 2017. J.A. 3–13. In its ruling, the court stated that\n its rationale actually warranted “judgment in favor of\n [TecSec]” on Adobe’s ineligibility challenge. J.A. 8.\n     In April 2018, after additional discovery, Adobe filed\n another motion for summary judgment of noninfringe-\n ment, making at least one argument for lack of provable\n inducement of infringement. See ECF 1054 (motion); ECF\n 1123 at 10–11 (reply supporting motion). The district court\n denied the motion in June 2018. J.A. 10298–99. In August\n 2018, Adobe stipulated that “on at least one occasion,”\n “there was direct infringement of the asserted claims” by\n an Adobe employee. J.A. 10307–08. It is common ground\n on appeal that this stipulation was referring to an occasion\n when an Adobe employee performed the steps of the\n method claims using an accused version of Adobe’s Acrobat\n product, reflected in a February 2009 blog post on\n\fCase: 19-2192     Document: 60     Page: 6    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                   TECSEC, INC.   v.

J.A. 26–29. The court\n based its decision on what Adobe treats as two independent\n grounds. First, the court held that, after the favorable\n 2011 claim construction, which was reasonable even\n though it was later reversed, it was impossible as a matter\n of law for Adobe to have had the requisite intent to induce\n third-party infringement. J.A. 27. Second, the court stated\n that, while allowing TecSec to argue inducement of in-\n fringement without permitting Adobe to introduce the\n three documents at issue would highly prejudice Adobe, ad-\n mitting that evidence would be prejudicial to TecSec and\n confuse the jury. J.A. 28–29. The court therefore barred\n the presentation of all inducement evidence concerning the\n period after March 3, 2011.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n     The case proceeded </span><pre class=\"inline\">to a jury trial, which began on De-\n cember 10, 2018. 1 On December 12, 2018, TecSec stipu-\n lated that, because it had failed to mark its product in\n accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 287, it would not seek damages\n for any infringement that took place before the filing of its\n complaint. J.A. 11998. Accordingly, the trial was limited\n\n\n     1    By December 9, 2018, the only patent claims at is-\n sue were the ’702 patent’s claims 1 and 8; the ’755 patent’s\n claim 1; the ’781 patent’s claims 1 and 14; and the ’452 pa-\n tent’s claim 1. J.A. 11994. Several additional claims had\n been at issue at the time of the § 101 ruling.

See J.A. 38–44.\n     At trial, TecSec offered the deposition testimony of\n George Johnson, an independent technology consultant, as\n evidence of direct infringement by third parties allegedly\n induced by Adobe. Mr. Johnson had stated that, in April\n 2011, he provided Acrobat users with guidance on how to\n use certain features. The court excluded certain parts of\n Mr. Johnson’s testimony, stating that the period for induce-\n ment ended on March 3, 2011, and that TecSec could not\n submit evidence of later conduct. J.A. 12429–30.\n     At the conclusion of trial, the court gave the jury two\n instructions relevant to this appeal. Jury Instruction No.\n 25 highlighted Adobe’s stipulation that the 2009 employee\n blog post constituted direct infringement, and it noted that\n this act had occurred before TecSec filed its complaint in\n 2010. J.A. 12076; see J.A. 10307–08. Jury Instruction No.\n 28 stated that “mere inaction, or a failure to stop or prevent\n infringement, does not constitute inducement.” J.A. 12079.\n     On December 19, 2018, the jury, besides confirming\n TecSec’s ownership of the patents, J.A. 39, found that\n Adobe had directly infringed all asserted claims, but that\n Adobe had not committed inducement of infringement, J.A.\n 40–41. The jury also found that Adobe had failed to estab-\n lish that the asserted claims were invalid under the prior\n art. J.A. 42–43. The jury awarded TecSec $1.75 million in\n damages. J.A. 44.\n     The district court then ruled on Adobe’s post-trial mo-\n tion. It declined to disturb the verdicts on direct infringe-\n ment and invalidity, J.A. 53–55, but it vacated the jury’s\n damages award and set damages to zero, J.A. 55–60. The\n court explained that TecSec’s only evidence of damages re-\n lated to sales of Acrobat software to customers and that\n\fCase: 19-2192       Document: 60     Page: 9   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v.

First, the district court explained that the\n March 3, 2011 claim construction and stipulation of nonin-\n fringement made it legally impossible for Adobe to have\n had, after that date, the knowledge—of the infringing char-\n acter of the allegedly induced customer actions—required\n for inducement.

Specifically, we have\n held that, under Halo Electronics, Inc. v. Pulse Electronics,\n Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court held that, even though it\n would be not just incorrect but unreasonable as a matter of\n law for the taxpayer to believe that the statute did not re-\n quire payment, the jury had to be permitted to decide\n whether the taxpayer in good faith believed the incorrect,\n legally unreasonable view that no tax was due.</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"> <a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 202–\n 04. </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">Thus, the legally material question of what the defend-\n ant subjectively believed was not answered as a matter of\n law even by the objective unreasonableness of that belief.\n Likewise, the question whether the defendant subjectively\n had what turned out to be the correct belief (here, that\n Adobe believed that the claims meant what we eventually\n held in 2013) is not answered as a matter of law by the ob-\n jective reasonableness of a contrary belief.\n     The district court in this case erred when it concluded\n as a matter of law that, after the district court’s (later re-\n versed) claim construction on March 3, 2011, Adobe “lacked\n the requisite intent to induce infringement.” J.A. 27. The\n court explained that it had “reasonably, though errone-\n ously, ruled in Adobe’s favor on infringement,” and, accord-\n ingly, Adobe was entitled to rely on that ruling as proof\n that the relevant induced acts were non-infringing.</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"> <a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span></a>\n That reasoning makes </span><pre class=\"inline\">dispositive what Adobe, with objec-\n tive reasonableness, could have believed. The Global-Tech\n inducement standard, however, can be met by proof of what\n Adobe in fact subjectively believed. For example, Adobe\n might have believed that the March 2011 claim-construc-\n tion ruling was erroneous (though reasonable) and would\n likely be reversed (as it was in 2013). Thus, the district\n court’s March 2011 ruling “could, at most, create a factual\n question, not an entitlement to a no-knowledge finding as\n a matter of law.” Smith & Nephew, 603 F. App’x at 989–\n 90.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 13   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                               13\n\n\n\n     For those reasons, we conclude that the district court\n legally erred in its primary rationale for ruling out induce-\n ment after March 3, 2011, namely, that the claim-construc-\n tion ruling of that date furnished an objectively reasonable\n basis for a belief that use of the accused products did not\n infringe, even if Adobe did not have such a belief.\n                                2\n     The district court’s second ground for its motion-in-\n limine ruling was that “allowing TecSec to argue [post-\n March 3, 2011] induced or willful infringement . . . would\n taint the trial and any verdict with undue prejudice and\n juror confusion.” J.A. 28. Whether we review that ruling\n de novo or for an abuse of discretion, we conclude that the\n district court erred in relying on this rationale to preclude\n TecSec from proving inducement after March 3, 2011.\n      In defending the district court’s rationale, Adobe in-\n vokes Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which pro-\n vides that a court “may exclude relevant evidence if its\n probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger\n of,” among other factors, “unfair prejudice” or “confusing\n the issues.” But the district court in this case went beyond\n excluding a single piece, or even a fixed set, of evidence and\n leaving TecSec to present such other relevant, admissible\n evidence as it may have on inducement in the period at is-\n sue. Instead, the court foreclosed the introduction of any\n evidence on the issue of post-March 3, 2011 inducement of\n infringement. This is materially different from any appli-\n cation of Rule 403 Adobe has identified. Cf. General Dy-\n namics Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"217288\"><a href=\"/opinion/217288/general-dynamics-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484–85 (2011)\n (distinguishing case involving “purely evidentiary dispute”\n over state-secret privilege, where “the privileged infor-\n mation is excluded and the trial goes on without it,” from\n case involving foreclosure of a claim).\n     The district court reasoned that if TecSec was allowed\n to argue inducement of infringement after that date, Adobe\n would be prejudiced were it not allowed to introduce the\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60     Page: 14    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14                                 TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n March 3, 2011 claim construction and the stipulation by\n TecSec that, under that construction, Adobe’s customers\n did not directly infringe. J.A. 28. The court then concluded\n that “it would also be substantially and unduly prejudicial\n and confusing for the jury to see a prior ruling in this case\n and TecSec’s stipulation that Adobe’s products did not in-\n fringe.” J.A. 28–29. On that basis, the district court pre-\n cluded TecSec from offering any proof of post-March 3,\n 2011 inducement.\n     Adobe has not cited any authority that supports such\n foreclosure of liability for a given period in the circum-\n stances present here. Any conclusion that post-March 3,\n 2011 inducement could not be fairly tried would have re-\n quired consideration of what other admissible evidence\n TecSec had that was relevant to the intent element of in-\n ducement, as well as of the possible measures for effec-\n tively but fairly reducing jury confusion. But the district\n court did not undertake, and because of the limited scope\n of Adobe’s motion in limine was in no position to undertake,\n that required consideration.\n      Adobe’s motion, besides what it suggested on the legal-\n impossibility point, was limited to arguing for Adobe’s abil-\n ity to introduce the claim-construction ruling and TecSec’s\n stipulation. It did not call for TecSec to identify all evi-\n dence of intent—as a motion for summary judgment would\n have done—so that the district court could determine if\n there was a triable issue of post-March 3, 2011 inducement\n of infringement. See J.A. 10429. TecSec therefore properly\n limited its response to arguing against the admission of the\n construction and stipulation. See J.A. 10849. On the mo-\n tion as framed, the district court lacked the basis to con-\n sider the totality of TecSec’s post-March 3, 2011\n inducement evidence to determine whether that issue\n could fairly be tried. And the court did not consider the\n totality of such evidence. Nor, in taking the extraordinary\n action of foreclosing liability for a substantial period, did\n the district court set forth an analysis of potential means,\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60    Page: 15    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v.

None of those cases support\n the ruling in this case. The cited cases all involved ordi-\n nary motions for summary judgment that, with proper pro-\n cedural protections, duly enabled the court to consider all\n evidence relevant to the particular liability issue.

By con-\n trast, Adobe’s motion in limine did not call for, or provide a\n basis for, consideration of all relevant material evidence.\n Without such consideration, the district court could not\n properly resolve the issue as a matter of law. 2\n      As Adobe acknowledges in this court, see Cross-Appel-\n lant’s Principal and Response Br. at 15, 20, when the dis-\n trict court stated that it would be “substantially and\n unduly prejudicial and confusing for the jury to see” the\n claim-construction ruling and TecSec’s stipulation, J.A.\n 28–29, the court was determining that the evidence Adobe\n was entitled to introduce would be “unduly prejudicial” to\n TecSec. But TecSec never stated that, if that evidence had\n to be admitted at Adobe’s behest, TecSec would drop its in-\n ducement claim for the post-March 3, 2011 period. To the\n\n\n     2    Adobe has not argued in its briefing in this court\n that any error in the motion-in-limine ruling was harmless\n because TecSec lacked sufficient evidence of intent to cre-\n ate a triable issue. See Cross-Appellant’s Principal and Re-\n sponse Br. at 19–34.\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60     Page: 16    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16                                TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.\n\n\n\n contrary, after the district court opined at the oral argu-\n ment that admitting that evidence would be “far too preju-\n dicial,” ECF 1294 at 36, TecSec reiterated its intent to\n present the inducement case even if that evidence were ad-\n mitted. TecSec’s Supp. MIL Br. (ECF 1283-1) at 7. The\n court furnished no justification for making that determina-\n tion itself instead of leaving to TecSec the determination\n that the prejudice to TecSec was too severe for the issue to\n be tried at all.\n     Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s decision to\n preclude TecSec from introducing evidence of post-March\n 3, 2011 inducement of infringement.\n                              3\n      TecSec’s appeal of the exclusion of certain aspects of\n Mr. Johnson’s deposition testimony is closely tied to the\n motion-in-limine ruling. In the testimony at issue, Mr.\n Johnson stated that, in April 2011, he had posted responses\n on an Adobe forum explaining how to use Acrobat products\n in ways that TecSec alleged were infringing. At trial,\n Adobe objected to the introduction of that testimony, argu-\n ing that the testimony “runs afoul of the Court’s [motion-\n in-limine] ruling on eliciting alleged infringement [post-\n March 3, 2011].” J.A. 12427. The district court agreed with\n Adobe, excluding the testimony because “it’s outside of the\n timeframe and it is clearly inducement evidence.” J.A.\n 12429–30. Because we conclude that the district court\n erred in its motion-in-limine ruling that was the basis for\n the exclusion of the Johnson testimony at issue, we reverse\n that evidentiary exclusion as well.\n                              B\n     TecSec challenges Jury Instruction Nos. 25 and 28.

That instruction mirrors Adobe’s pre-trial stipula-\n tion, differing only in its specific reference to the February\n 2009 blog post. See J.A. 10307.\n     TecSec challenges the district court’s inclusion of the\n reference to the February 2009 blog post, stating that\n “TecSec never agreed that Adobe only admitted to a single\n act of infringement” and that the “instruction is misleading\n because it implies that, in the context of the district court’s\n narrow damages window, Adobe’s 2009 blog is irrelevant.”\n Appellant’s Br. at 43–44. We reject the challenge.\n      TecSec relies on a single piece of evidence as showing a\n broader Adobe admission, namely, Adobe’s stipulation that\n it had “installed for its own internal use at least one copy\n of each version of the accused products on a computer hav-\n ing system memory.” J.A. 11994 (emphasis added). But\n Jury Instruction No. 25 is best understood to tie “the one\n time” language, to which TecSec objects, to what the imme-\n diately preceding two sentences discuss, which is on its face\n performance of a method. Installation, by contrast, could\n constitute infringement only of the system claims. See J.A.\n 12769 (Trial Tr. at 534:4–5). The installation action thus\n is simply outside the scope of, and does not contradict, Jury\n Instruction No. 25—which left TecSec free to argue that\n there were instances of Adobe-admitted infringement of\n the system claims. Moreover, the reference to the timing\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60     Page: 18    Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18                                TECSEC, INC.   v.

We therefore\n find no reversible error in Jury Instruction No. 25, without\n foreclosing the district court, in any new trial on induce-\n ment after March 3, 2011, from considering whether the\n instruction should be modified.\n                              2\n     In Jury Instruction No. 28, the district court told the\n jury that inducement of infringement requires “an affirm-\n ative act to encourage infringement” and that “[e]vidence\n of mere inaction, or a failure to stop or prevent infringe-\n ment, does not constitute inducement.” J.A. 12079.

Specifically,\n TecSec highlights § 284’s statements that “[u]pon finding\n for the claimant the court shall award the claimant dam-\n ages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in\n no event less than a reasonable royalty” and that “[w]hen\n the damages are not found by a jury, the court shall assess\n them.” 35 U.S.C. § 284. Taken together, TecSec contends,\n those statements require an award of damages greater\n than zero in all cases where the jury finds infringement.\n     The statute does not require an award of damages if\n none are proven that adequately tie a dollar amount to the\n infringing acts.

But the district court found,\n and TecSec does not dispute, that direct infringement oc-\n curs only after Acrobat is installed. J.A. 57. Sales of Acro-\n bat, therefore, cannot be a measure of damages for direct\n infringement by Adobe—sales could serve here as a meas-\n ure of damages only for TecSec’s indirect infringement the-\n ory, which relies on infringement by Adobe customers. But\n the jury found no indirect infringement.\n     On appeal, TecSec tries to rationalize the jury’s award\n by theorizing ways the jury could have used sales data to\n derive a value for Adobe’s conduct. For instance, TecSec\n argues that the jury could have decided that sales were a\n good proxy for the value of TecSec’s patented invention to\n Adobe’s development of Acrobat. Appellant’s Opening Br.\n at 59–60. But this theory, like the others that TecSec of-\n fers, is ultimately speculative and insufficiently grounded\n in evidence.

It goes beyond managing access to objects\n using multiple levels of encryption, as required by “multi-\n level . . . security.” Notably, it expressly requires, as well,\n accessing an “object-oriented key manager” and specified\n uses of a “label” as well as encryption for the access man-\n agement. ’702 patent, col. 12, lines 4–16. To disregard\n those express claim elements is to proceed at “a high level\n of abstraction” that is “untethered from the claim lan-\n guage” and that “overgeneraliz[es] the claim.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Enfish,</span> <span class=\"volume\">822</span>\n <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1337</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> at 1338.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">      As to the key-manager requirement, we explained in\n TecSec II that the requirement was important during pros-\n ecution. Specifically, rather than deleting the claim limi-\n tation after an indefiniteness rejection, TecSec amended\n the specification to provide the required clarity by adding\n what now appears at ’702 patent, col. 1, line 61, to col. 2,\n line 4, which provided the definition that this court even-\n tually relied on in construing “object-oriented key man-\n ager.” TecSec II, 658 F.

As to the\n combination of labeling with the required encryption, the\n specification makes clear that this is part of the focus of the\n claimed advance. The specification expressly identifies a\n deficiency of using only multilevel security through encryp-\n tion requiring keys at more than one level: that approach,\n the specification says, “is quite unwieldy, inflexible, and\n difficult to manage by a security officer or key administra-\n tor.” ’702 patent, col. 2, lines 25–29. The specification then\n explains that it proposes a solution in which “[a] secure\n method of labelling files or messages that are sent from a\n sending user to a receiving user over a network” is used “in\n addition to cryptographic protection.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.,</span> col. 2, lines </span><pre class=\"inline\">30–\n 33 (emphasis added).

The focus of\n the claimed advance cannot ignore all but the multilevel\n encryption.\n      The specification elaborates in a way that simultane-\n ously shows that the claims at issue are directed at solving\n a problem specific to computer data networks. The patent\n focuses on allowing for the simultaneous transmission of\n secure information to a large group of recipients connected\n to a decentralized network—an important feature of data\n networks—but without uniform access to all data by all re-\n cipients.

While non-computer settings may have se-\n curity issues addressed by multilevel security, it does not\n follow that all patents relating to multilevel security are\n necessarily ineligible for patenting. Here, although the pa-\n tent involves multilevel security, that does not negate the\n conclusion that the patent is aimed at solving a particular\n problem of multicasting computer networks.\n     By way of comparison, in Uniloc, we held the claims at\n issue to be directed to solving a problem of reducing com-\n munication time by using otherwise-unused space in a par-\n ticular protocol-based </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">system,</span> <span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1307–09,\n even though reducing communication time by using such\n available blank space (or, generally, reducing resource use\n by using otherwise-unused available resources) is a goal in\n many settings. Similarly, in Ancora, we held the claims at\n issue to be directed to solving a problem presented by par-\n ticularly easy unauthorized use of software by placing the\n software in an especially secure computer </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">location,</span> <span class=\"volume\">908</span>\n <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1349</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, even though placing items in especially se-\n cure locations to prevent unauthorized access is a goal in\n many settings. The patent claims at issue here are directed\n to improving a data network’s basic functioning by ena-\n bling secure and efficient transmission to intended recipi-\n ents when use is made of the basic multicasting\n functionality of such a data network. As the district court\n said, the claims address the data-network problem pre-\n sented by “multiple users in multiple locations accessing\n information at different security levels from a central re-\n pository.” J.A. 10.\n     A second inquiry significant in our case law remains—\n whether the claims provide a “specific” solution in the way\n our cases discuss. For similar reasons to those mentioned\n above, Adobe has not persuaded us that the claims fail to\n do so, because its arguments ignore what plainly are im-\n portant aspects of the claims and the focus of the claimed\n advance in the combination. See, e.g., J.A. 1857 (arguing\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60     Page: 29   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v. ADOBE INC.                              29\n\n\n\n that the “asserted claims of the DCOM patents are directed\n to the abstract idea of managing access to objects using\n multiple levels of encryption, and fail to provide any spe-\n cific solution for accomplishing that claimed result”).\n     In these circumstances, we conclude that the district\n court correctly rejected Adobe’s ineligibility challenge as\n Adobe presented it to that court.\n                                C\n      On appeal, Adobe seeks to modify its definition of what\n the asserted claims are directed to, now contending that\n “[t]he representative claims are directed to the abstract\n idea of managing access to objects using multiple layers of\n encryption and labels.” Cross-Appellant Principal and Re-\n sponse Br. at 61 (emphasis added). This is a new formula-\n tion on appeal. Adobe cites J.A. 1853 and 1857 following\n the just-quoted sentence, but neither those pages nor any\n others in Adobe’s summary-judgment motion identify the\n encryption/labeling combination as the abstract idea to\n which the claims are directed. As recited above, Adobe\n omitted labeling—as well as the object-oriented key man-\n ager—from its characterization of the purported abstract\n idea in the district court.\n      For the reasons we have set forth, Adobe’s change in its\n “articulation of the purported abstract idea” is substan-\n tively significant. Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L. v. LG\n Electronics, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1362 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2018)\n (declining to decide waiver where the appellant’s “articula-\n tion of the purported abstract idea was advanced for the\n first time on appeal”). Adobe’s analysis on appeal is still\n deficient.\n     When Adobe discusses what is now in its formulation\n of the asserted abstract idea, it does not meaningfully ad-\n dress the combination. Rather, it asserts the “common-\n place” character of the individual component techniques\n generally, see Cross-Appellant Principal and Response Br.\n\fCase: 19-2192    Document: 60      Page: 30   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n 30                                 TECSEC, INC.   v.

Moreover, to the extent, if any,\n that extrinsic evidence is relevant to the summary-judg-\n ment analysis at Step 1, the evidence is one-sided. TecSec\n submitted an expert declaration asserting that the combi-\n nation of techniques we have discussed was a specific, un-\n conventional improvement in computer network\n functionality. J.A. 1960–72; see also J.A. 13 (denying\n Adobe’s motion to strike portions of TecSec’s declaration).\n Adobe has pointed to no evidence of its own that it submit-\n ted in support of its § 101 motion. 4\n     For those reasons, even apart from its departure from\n the theory presented in the district court, the analysis\n Adobe has presented on appeal is insufficient to make the\n showing required for ineligibility.\n                              IV\n     For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district\n court is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the case\n is remanded for further proceedings on TecSec’s claim of\n inducement of infringement.\n\n\n\n      4  In this court, Adobe has cited a statement con-\n tained in an expert report from its expert, J.A. 7980, but\n TecSec notes, without contradiction from Adobe, that\n Adobe did not present the statement in the summary-judg-\n ment proceedings regarding § 101 eligibility, see Plaintiff-\n Appellant Corrected Response and Reply Brief at 54 n.16.\n\fCase: 19-2192      Document: 60   Page: 31   Filed: 10/23/2020\n\n\n\n\n TECSEC, INC.   v.

(“Finjan”) appeals from an order issued by\n the United States District Court for the Northern District\n of California (“Unsealing Order”) amid patent-infringe-\n ment litigation between Finjan and Juniper Networks, Inc.\n (“Juniper”). That order provides for unsealing a Daubert-\n related order (“Daubert Order”) and states in full:\n       The order on the Daubert motions, filed under seal\n       today, shall remain under seal for two weeks, dur-\n       ing which one or more parties may seek appellate\n       review of this order to obtain redactions.

The district court stayed un-\n sealing of the Daubert Order pending this appeal. J.A. 14.\n     Finjan asks us to reverse the Unsealing Order and is-\n sue an order of our own “granting limited redactions of\n eight lines” of the Daubert Order that Finjan asserts dis-\n close confidential licensing terms discussed between Fin-\n jan and third-party licensees. Appellant’s Br. 4. Juniper\n does not oppose. We have jurisdiction under the collateral\n order doctrine. See Uniloc 2017 LLC v. Apple, Inc., 964\n F.3d 1351, 1357–58 (Fed. Cir. 2020); Apple Inc. v.

Cir. 2013).\n                          DISCUSSION\n     “Where, as here, an appeal does not involve substan-\n tive issues of patent law, we apply the law of the regional\n circuit in which the district court sits.” Apple, 727 F.3d\n\fCase: 19-1837       Document: 40      Page: 3   Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n FINJAN, INC.   v. JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC.                     3\n\n\n\n at 1220. Courts in the Ninth Circuit “must conscientiously\n balance the competing interests of the public and the party\n who seeks to keep certain judicial records secret.” Id. at\n 1221 (citing Kamakana v. City & Cty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d\n 1172, 1179 (9th Cir. 2006)). In Uniloc, for example, we va-\n cated and remanded a portion of an order that “failed to\n make findings sufficient to allow us to adequately assess\n whether [the district court] properly balanced the public’s\n right of access against the interests of the third parties in\n shielding their financial and licensing information from\n public view.” 964 F.3d at 1364. We do the same here. The\n district court did not perform the required analysis. That\n analysis is not for us to undertake in the first instance.\n Therefore, we vacate the Unsealing Order and remand for\n the district court to “make particularized determinations\n as to whether and, if so, to what extent” the third-party li-\n censing information raised by Finjan should be made pub-\n lic. 1 Id.\n                           CONCLUSION\n     For the above reasons, the appealed order is vacated\n and the case is remanded for further proceedings con-\n sistent with this opinion.\n                 VACATED AND REMANDED\n                              COSTS\n     No costs.\n\n\n\n\n     1  Our mere vacatur of the Unsealing Order will not\n have the effect of unsealing the currently sealed Daubert\n Order.\n\f",

WILKIE                                              3\n\n\n\n   Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge NEWMAN.\n      Additional views filed by Circuit Judge REYNA.\n NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\n     Petitioners Conley F. Monk, Jr. and seven other veter-\n ans petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for Vet-\n erans Claims (“Veterans Court”), requesting class action\n certification for the class of veterans whose disability\n claims had not been resolved by the Board of Veterans Ap-\n peals (“BVA” or “Board”) within one year of the filing of a\n Notice of Disagreement (“NOD”). Petitioners define the\n proposed class as:\n    [I]ndividuals who . . . applied for and [were] denied\n    VA [Veterans Affairs] disability benefits, in whole\n    or in part; [and] timely filed an NOD upon denial\n    of an original, reopened, or remanded claim; [and]\n    the VA has failed to render a decision on the pend-\n    ing appeal within twelve (12) months of the date of\n    the NOD.\n Amended Petition at 7 (Dec. 20, 2017) (ECF No. 57). Peti-\n tioners request judicial action to compel the Secretary of\n Veterans Affairs to decide all pending appeals within one\n year of receipt of a timely NOD. Petitioners stated that the\n proposed class constituted at least 470,000 claimants, and\n was increasing.\n     The Veterans Court took the matter en banc, and re-\n quested Petitioners to separate or limit the requested class\n action into issues that meet the “commonality” standard of\n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2):\n    A class action may be maintained if . . . the party\n    opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\n    grounds that apply generally to the class, so that\n    final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\n    relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\n\fCase: 19-1094     Document: 92     Page: 4    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                             MONK v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners declined to limit the requested class action,\n stating that “systemic delay” exists in the VA claims sys-\n tem, and broad judicial remedy is required. The Veterans\n Court then denied the requested class certification, 1 stat-\n ing that “[t]he relief the petitioners seek does not satisfy\n Rule 23(b)(2)’s standard as there is no single injunction\n that provides relief to the class as a whole.” Vet. Ct. Op. at\n 181. This appeal followed.\n                         DISCUSSION\n     While this case was pending in the Veterans Court,\n congressional hearings were held in 2016 and 2017 con-\n cerning the delays in VA claim processing. Legislation was\n enacted on August 23, 2017, called the Veterans Appeals\n Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, Pub. L. No.\n 115-55, § 2(x), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017) (“AMA” or “VAIMA”).\n In their appeal to this court, Petitioners acknowledged this\n legislation but did not discuss its impact on their concerns.\n We requested further briefing, and Petitioners, the govern-\n ment, and amicus curiae National Law School Veterans\n Clinic Consortium filed additional briefs. Petitioners and\n the amicus state that important problems remain; the gov-\n ernment reports progress and optimism.\n     A. The AMA Enactment in 2017\n     Before the AMA, the system for processing veterans’\n disability claims required multiple steps, each of which\n was subject to delays, starting with the procedures in the\n Regional Office, then the filing of the NOD, then the issu-\n ance of a Statement of the Case (“SOC”), then the filing of\n VA Form 9, then the appeal certification and transfer to\n the BVA, then the submission of evidence, then a hearing,\n often warranting remand and additional evidence and\n\n\n\n     1    Monk v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 167 (2018) (“Vet. Ct.\n Op.”).\n\fCase: 19-1094     Document: 92    Page: 5    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n MONK v. WILKIE                                            5\n\n\n\n another hearing, and eventually the decision of the BVA\n and a possible reconsideration decision. The average com-\n pletion time is “nearly five years” according to the govern-\n ment, and seven years according to Petitioners. Petitioners\n state that delay of ten years is not unusual.\n     The AMA made several changes in VA procedures, and\n eliminated or simplified the steps after filing of the NOD.\n As described by the government:\n    Rather than forcing all claimants through one long\n    queue, the AMA allows claimants to choose an ap-\n    pellate path—(1) higher-level review, (2) supple-\n    mental claim, (3) board review with a hearing and\n    opportunity to submit additional evidence,\n    (4) board review without a hearing, but with an op-\n    portunity to submit additional evidence, or\n    (5) board review without a hearing or additional\n    evidence—in accord with their priorities for their\n    particular appeal. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1),\n    7105(b)(3).\n Gov’t Supp. Br. 2–3. The government states that the AMA\n is structured to avoid the major sources of delay that were\n inherent in the legacy system: 2\n    For instance, instead of the legacy system’s contin-\n    ual open record and continual duty to assist—\n    which cause the board to reintroduce thousands of\n    cases reaching the end of the appeals process back\n    into the appellate queue for additional develop-\n    ment every year—the AMA provides discrete\n\n\n\n    2    The pre-AMA appeals process is called the “legacy\n system.” The AMA applies to claims that receive an initial\n decision after February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. Veter-\n ans within the legacy system are authorized to “opt in” to\n the AMA system.\n\fCase: 19-1094    Document: 92     Page: 6    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                            MONK v.

The govern-\n ment also explains that instead of waiting for preparation\n and issuance of the SOC and then having to file an appeal\n that must be certified and transferred to the BVA, claim-\n ants can file their NOD directly with the BVA. Id. at 3–4.\n      The amicus reports that “the average length of time be-\n tween the filing of an appeal at the Regional Office and the\n Board’s disposition of the appeal was more than three\n years—1,273 days—for legacy claims.” Amicus Supp. Br. 2\n (citing Dep’t of Veterans Aff. Board of Veterans Appeals,\n Annual Report Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 25) (“Annual Report\n FY 2019”) (emphasis omitted). The government summa-\n rizes: “Given that the SOC, certification, and board docket-\n ing stages for legacy appeals take 1,077 days on average to\n complete, the AMA’s authorization for direct NOD filings\n with the board has the potential to remove up to 1,077 days\n of processing time for the average claimant.” Gov’t Supp.\n Br. 4 (citing Annual Report FY 2019 at 25). The govern-\n ment states:\n     This careful structuring of the AMA system has, at\n     least so far, vastly improved appeal processing\n     times. As of May 31, 2020, AMA claimants who ap-\n     peal to the board are receiving decisions, on aver-\n     age, in 229 days.

The gov-\n ernment states that the AMA provides that legacy claim-\n ants may “opt in” to the AMA system. The government\n states that “virtually every single putative class member\n has had an opportunity to leave the broken legacy appeals\n system and enter an AMA system that ‘expedite[s] VA’s ap-\n peals process’ while also ‘protecting veterans’ due process\n rights.’ H.R. Rep. 115-135, at 2. Some have declined that\n opportunity, and that is their right.” Gov’t Supp. Br. 6\n (alteration in original). The government states that the VA\n sent a letter to almost every legacy claimant to inform them\n of the legislative change and to provide instructions con-\n cerning procedures, id., and Petitioners report that only\n 19.2% of the legacy claimants opted in to the AMA in the\n first and second quarters of FY 2019. Pet’r Supp. Br. 11.\n      The government states that “the AMA has been fully\n operational for 17 months; and, between RAMP [Rapid Ap-\n peals Modernization Program] and the AMA’s opt-in, vir-\n tually every putative class member has had an opportunity\n to take advantage of Congress’s chosen remedy.” Gov’t\n Supp. Br. 7. The government reports the hiring of 605 ad-\n ditional appeal adjudicators in FY 2019, and states that:\n “While the original briefs in this case referred to 470,000\n pending appeals, the latest available data reflects that\n 217,918 legacy appeals remain pending: 141,783 appeals\n that have not yet received a board decision and 76,135 ap-\n peals remanded by the board,” and “[b]ased on current pro-\n jections, all legacy appeals will receive a board decision by\n December 2022.” Id. at 12 n.10 (citing U.S. Dep’t of Veter-\n ans Aff., Periodic Progress Report on Appeals 4–5, 29 (Feb.\n 2020 Update) and Dep’t of Veterans Aff., Appeals Modern-\n ization Act Reporting: May 2020 Monthly Report). 3\n\n\n\n     3   The AMA requires the VA to provide regular up-\n dates on appeal processing, including resource and staffing\n levels, productivity and timeline projections, and\n\fCase: 19-1094     Document: 92      Page: 8    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                              MONK v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n     However, Petitioners continue to press for a class ac-\n tion for the purpose of setting a deadline for legacy appeals,\n arguing that the AMA’s provision to opt-in is inadequate,\n and judicial intervention is essential. Pet’r Supp. Br. 10–\n 12 (“For veterans already suffering lengthy delays, opting\n in to the AMA, an untested and unfamiliar system, risked\n even further costs and uncertainties.”).\n     The government states that the concept of a fixed pe-\n riod was considered at the legislative hearings, and that\n the consensus was that a deadline system was not a pref-\n erable solution, in view of the variety of veterans’ disability\n claims and individual needs and procedures.\n     On review of the information provided by both sides,\n we share the view stated in Sugrue v. Derwinski, 26 F.3d\n 8, 12–13 (2d Cir. 1994), that when Congress has “carefully\n crafted” a “comprehensive remedial structure,” that struc-\n ture warrants evaluation in practice, before judicial inter-\n vention should be contemplated.\n     C. The Question of “Commonality”\n     The Veterans Court observed that the rule of “common-\n ality” requires that a proposed class action presents a com-\n mon question that is capable of a common legal answer.\n See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350–52\n (2011). See also Martin v. O’Rourke, 891 F.3d 1338, 1345–\n 47 (Fed.

And\n Petitioners do not elaborate on the remedy they seek for\n legacy claimants, other than a one-year deadline. The ami-\n cus states that “it is too early to tell if the AMA provides\n veterans with accurate and timely decisions,” Amicus\n Supp. Br. 1, and therefore the courts must intervene in the\n legacy system for veterans who have not opted into the\n AMA. The amicus mentions the government’s projection\n that all legacy appeals will be resolved by the end of 2022,\n and is skeptical concerning whether this goal can be\n achieved. Thus the amicus urges that judicial intervention\n by class action is needed. Id. at 2, 10. The amicus, like\n Petitioners, suggests no remedy other than imposition of a\n judicially imposed one-year deadline.\n     The amicus presented the experience of a veteran’s\n clinic in attempting to proceed under an opt-in election,\n showing repeated VA errors in administration of the pur-\n portedly more efficient AMA procedures. This distressing\n case history does not provide reassurance, whether it is an\n isolated example, or widespread. However, neither does\n this information enlighten the commonality concern that\n troubled the Veterans Court.\n      The Veterans Court held that there was inadequate\n specificity of issues on which the court could reasonably\n proceed by class action. Petitioners ask this court to hold\n that the proposed class of all legacy claimants “satisfies\n commonality under Rule 23(a)(2),” Pet’r Supp. Br. 12. Pe-\n titioners fault the Veterans Court for not allowing them to\n amend their petition after the en banc argument, in order\n to “move for certification of subclasses as necessary.” Pet’r.\n Supp. Br. 6 n.3. However, we are not advised as to further\n analysis of what legal remedy is sought for any subclass.\n    We agree with the Veterans Court that Petitioners\n have not met the commonality requirement, or suggested a\n path to meeting this requirement.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n       The VA concedes that veterans, “[w]hen they [ap-\n peal]—whether they know it or not—will enter into a pro-\n cess that takes years, sometimes decades, to complete . . .\n jump[ing] through hoops, absorb[ing] dozens of letters,\n fill[ing] out confusing paperwork, and learn[ing] to live\n with waiting.” J.A. 466. This delay is unacceptable. In\n addition to learning to live with waiting, the nation’s vet-\n erans must carry the burden of compounding health and\n financial implications. While we note the recent attempts\n to reform the broken VA claims system, J.A. 467, the new\n process does not provide a remedy for the 200,000 veterans\n that have claims pending under the legacy system. The\n government asserts that “virtually every putative class\n member has had an opportunity to take advantage of Con-\n gress’s chosen remedy.” Gov’t Supp. Br. 7. But the AMA\n opt-in was optional, and veterans with claims pending un-\n der the legacy system were not required to switch to the\n new system in order to receive swift adjudication. In fact,\n Congress explicitly prohibited the AMA from taking effect\n until the VA could guarantee that legacy claims would be\n “timely addressed.” Gov’t Supp. Br. 9 n.9. The fact re-\n mains that veterans should not have to switch to the new\n system to expect and receive timely resolution of their\n claims. It remains to be seen whether the new AMA sys-\n tem will resolve these deeply troubling delays. But in the\n meantime, the availability of class certification to address\n such delays remains available and important as ever.\n\f",

WILKIE                                              3\n\n\n\n   Opinion for the court filed by Circuit Judge NEWMAN.\n      Additional views filed by Circuit Judge REYNA.\n NEWMAN, Circuit Judge.\n     Petitioners Conley F. Monk, Jr. and seven other veter-\n ans petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for Vet-\n erans Claims (“Veterans Court”), requesting class action\n certification for the class of veterans whose disability\n claims had not been resolved by the Board of Veterans Ap-\n peals (“BVA” or “Board”) within one year of the filing of a\n Notice of Disagreement (“NOD”). Petitioners define the\n proposed class as:\n    [I]ndividuals who . . . applied for and [were] denied\n    VA [Veterans Affairs] disability benefits, in whole\n    or in part; [and] timely filed an NOD upon denial\n    of an original, reopened, or remanded claim; [and]\n    the VA has failed to render a decision on the pend-\n    ing appeal within twelve (12) months of the date of\n    the NOD.\n Amended Petition at 7 (Dec. 20, 2017) (ECF No. 57). Peti-\n tioners request judicial action to compel the Secretary of\n Veterans Affairs to decide all pending appeals within one\n year of receipt of a timely NOD. Petitioners stated that the\n proposed class constituted at least 470,000 claimants, and\n was increasing.\n     The Veterans Court took the matter en banc, and re-\n quested Petitioners to separate or limit the requested class\n action into issues that meet the “commonality” standard of\n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2):\n    A class action may be maintained if . . . the party\n    opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\n    grounds that apply generally to the class, so that\n    final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory\n    relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\n\fCase: 19-1094     Document: 92     Page: 4    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                             MONK v. WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n Petitioners declined to limit the requested class action,\n stating that “systemic delay” exists in the VA claims sys-\n tem, and broad judicial remedy is required. The Veterans\n Court then denied the requested class certification, 1 stat-\n ing that “[t]he relief the petitioners seek does not satisfy\n Rule 23(b)(2)’s standard as there is no single injunction\n that provides relief to the class as a whole.” Vet. Ct. Op. at\n 181. This appeal followed.\n                         DISCUSSION\n     While this case was pending in the Veterans Court,\n congressional hearings were held in 2016 and 2017 con-\n cerning the delays in VA claim processing. Legislation was\n enacted on August 23, 2017, called the Veterans Appeals\n Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017, Pub. L. No.\n 115-55, § 2(x), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017) (“AMA” or “VAIMA”).\n In their appeal to this court, Petitioners acknowledged this\n legislation but did not discuss its impact on their concerns.\n We requested further briefing, and Petitioners, the govern-\n ment, and amicus curiae National Law School Veterans\n Clinic Consortium filed additional briefs. Petitioners and\n the amicus state that important problems remain; the gov-\n ernment reports progress and optimism.\n     A. The AMA Enactment in 2017\n     Before the AMA, the system for processing veterans’\n disability claims required multiple steps, each of which\n was subject to delays, starting with the procedures in the\n Regional Office, then the filing of the NOD, then the issu-\n ance of a Statement of the Case (“SOC”), then the filing of\n VA Form 9, then the appeal certification and transfer to\n the BVA, then the submission of evidence, then a hearing,\n often warranting remand and additional evidence and\n\n\n\n     1    Monk v.

The average com-\n pletion time is “nearly five years” according to the govern-\n ment, and seven years according to Petitioners. Petitioners\n state that delay of ten years is not unusual.\n     The AMA made several changes in VA procedures, and\n eliminated or simplified the steps after filing of the NOD.\n As described by the government:\n    Rather than forcing all claimants through one long\n    queue, the AMA allows claimants to choose an ap-\n    pellate path—(1) higher-level review, (2) supple-\n    mental claim, (3) board review with a hearing and\n    opportunity to submit additional evidence,\n    (4) board review without a hearing, but with an op-\n    portunity to submit additional evidence, or\n    (5) board review without a hearing or additional\n    evidence—in accord with their priorities for their\n    particular appeal. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1),\n    7105(b)(3).\n Gov’t Supp. Br. 2–3. The government states that the AMA\n is structured to avoid the major sources of delay that were\n inherent in the legacy system: 2\n    For instance, instead of the legacy system’s contin-\n    ual open record and continual duty to assist—\n    which cause the board to reintroduce thousands of\n    cases reaching the end of the appeals process back\n    into the appellate queue for additional develop-\n    ment every year—the AMA provides discrete\n\n\n\n    2    The pre-AMA appeals process is called the “legacy\n system.” The AMA applies to claims that receive an initial\n decision after February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2. Veter-\n ans within the legacy system are authorized to “opt in” to\n the AMA system.\n\fCase: 19-1094    Document: 92     Page: 6    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                            MONK v.

The govern-\n ment also explains that instead of waiting for preparation\n and issuance of the SOC and then having to file an appeal\n that must be certified and transferred to the BVA, claim-\n ants can file their NOD directly with the BVA.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 3–4.\n</span><pre class=\"inline\">      The amicus reports that “the average length of time be-\n tween the filing of an appeal at the Regional Office and the\n Board’s disposition of the appeal was more than three\n years—1,273 days—for legacy claims.” Amicus Supp. Br. 2\n (citing Dep’t of Veterans Aff. Board of Veterans Appeals,\n Annual Report Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 25) (“Annual Report\n FY 2019”) (emphasis omitted). The government summa-\n rizes: “Given that the SOC, certification, and board docket-\n ing stages for legacy appeals take 1,077 days on average to\n complete, the AMA’s authorization for direct NOD filings\n with the board has the potential to remove up to 1,077 days\n of processing time for the average claimant.” Gov’t Supp.\n Br. 4 (citing Annual Report FY 2019 at 25). The govern-\n ment states:\n     This careful structuring of the AMA system has, at\n     least so far, vastly improved appeal processing\n     times. As of May 31, 2020, AMA claimants who ap-\n     peal to the board are receiving decisions, on aver-\n     age, in 229 days.

The gov-\n ernment states that the AMA provides that legacy claim-\n ants may “opt in” to the AMA system.

The government reports the hiring of 605 ad-\n ditional appeal adjudicators in FY 2019, and states that:\n “While the original briefs in this case referred to 470,000\n pending appeals, the latest available data reflects that\n 217,918 legacy appeals remain pending: 141,783 appeals\n that have not yet received a board decision and 76,135 ap-\n peals remanded by the board,” and “[b]ased on current pro-\n jections, all legacy appeals will receive a board decision by\n December 2022.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 12 </span><pre class=\"inline\">n.10 (citing U.S. Dep’t of Veter-\n ans Aff., Periodic Progress Report on Appeals 4–5, 29 (Feb.\n 2020 Update) and Dep’t of Veterans Aff., Appeals Modern-\n ization Act Reporting: May 2020 Monthly Report). 3\n\n\n\n     3   The AMA requires the VA to provide regular up-\n dates on appeal processing, including resource and staffing\n levels, productivity and timeline projections, and\n\fCase: 19-1094     Document: 92      Page: 8    Filed: 10/20/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                              MONK v.

WILKIE\n\n\n\n\n       The VA concedes that veterans, “[w]hen they [ap-\n peal]—whether they know it or not—will enter into a pro-\n cess that takes years, sometimes decades, to complete . . .\n jump[ing] through hoops, absorb[ing] dozens of letters,\n fill[ing] out confusing paperwork, and learn[ing] to live\n with waiting.” J.A. 466. This delay is unacceptable. In\n addition to learning to live with waiting, the nation’s vet-\n erans must carry the burden of compounding health and\n financial implications. While we note the recent attempts\n to reform the broken VA claims system, J.A. 467, the new\n process does not provide a remedy for the 200,000 veterans\n that have claims pending under the legacy system. The\n government asserts that “virtually every putative class\n member has had an opportunity to take advantage of Con-\n gress’s chosen remedy.” Gov’t Supp. Br. 7. But the AMA\n opt-in was optional, and veterans with claims pending un-\n der the legacy system were not required to switch to the\n new system in order to receive swift adjudication. In fact,\n Congress explicitly prohibited the AMA from taking effect\n until the VA could guarantee that legacy claims would be\n “timely addressed.” Gov’t Supp. Br. 9 n.9. The fact re-\n mains that veterans should not have to switch to the new\n system to expect and receive timely resolution of their\n claims. It remains to be seen whether the new AMA sys-\n tem will resolve these deeply troubling delays. But in the\n meantime, the availability of class certification to address\n such delays remains available and important as ever.\n\f</pre>",

We explained that the\npetition largely seeks to pursue arguments that this court\n\fCase: 20-136       Document: 38      Page: 2   Filed: 10/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n2                                          IN RE: ARUNACHALAM\n\n\n\n\nhas already repeatedly rejected, that, at a minimum, she\nlacked a clear and indisputable right to relief in seeking\nto vacate orders in closed cases listed in the caption, and\nthat for those cases in the caption that were ongoing or\nrecently resolved, Dr. Arunachalam had failed to explain\nwhy she lacks an alternative means for obtaining relief\nthrough the course of an appeal. Dr. Arunachalam peti-\ntioned for rehearing en banc, which the court denied. Dr.\nArunachalam then paid the filing fee.\n    Issuance of a writ of mandamus is a “drastic” remedy,\n“reserved for really extraordinary causes.” Ex parte\nFahey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104466\"><a href=\"/opinion/104466/ex-parte-fahey/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259–60 (1947).

DRIVERREACH, LLC\n\n\n\n HUGHES, Circuit Judge.\n     Tenstreet appeals the Southern District of Indiana’s\n determination that its patented method of using peer-to-\n peer networking to verify employment history is directed\n to patent-ineligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101.\n Because the district court correctly determined that the\n claims of the patent-in-suit are directed to an abstract idea\n and lack an inventive concept, we affirm.\n                               I\n     For motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Fed-\n eral Rules of Civil Procedure, we apply the law of the re-\n gional circuit. Bascom Glob. Internet Servs., Inc. v. AT&T\n Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The\n Seventh Circuit reviews a grant of a motion to dismiss de\n novo. Bible v. United Student Aid Funds, Inc., 799 F.3d\n 633, 639 (7th Cir. 2015). We review patent eligibility under\n 35 U.S.C. § 101 de novo. OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com,\n Inc., 788 F.3d 1359, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2015).\n     The Supreme Court has established a two-part test for\n determining patent eligibility under 35 U.S.C. § 101. Alice\n Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l, 573 U.S. 208, 217–18\n (2014). “We must first determine whether the claims at\n issue are directed to a patent-ineligible concept.” Id. If\n they are, we “consider the elements of each claim both in-\n dividually and ‘as an ordered combination’ to determine\n whether the additional elements ‘transform the nature of\n the claim’ into a patent-eligible application.” Id. (quoting\n Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc., 566\n U.S. 66, 78–79 (2012)).\n                              II\n     Tenstreet owns U.S. Patent No. 8,145,575 (the ’575 pa-\n tent), which recites a method for using a peer-to-peer net-\n work to verify the employment history of job applicants,\n particularly for use in the truck driving industry, where\n such verification is required by regulation. Tenstreet\n\fCase: 20-1101      Document: 49    Page: 3    Filed: 10/19/2020\n\n\n\n\n TENSTREET, LLC   v. DRIVERREACH, LLC                       3\n\n\n\n argues that the ’575 patent claims are patent eligible be-\n cause they provide three advantages over conventional pro-\n cesses for employment verification: (1) a single channel for\n routing transmissions; (2) the ability for job applicants to\n monitor the verification process; and (3) database storage\n of employment history.\n      The test for patent-eligible subject matter is not\n whether the claims are advantageous over the previous\n method. Even if the ’575 patent provides advantages over\n manual collection of data, the patent claims no technologi-\n cal improvement beyond the use of a generic computer net-\n work. Accordingly, the district court correctly determined\n that the ’575 patent claims are directed to the abstract idea\n of collecting, organizing, and storing data on a conventional\n computer network, and that the ’575 patent claims recite\n no elements that transform them to patent-eligible appli-\n cations.

See Foster v. Dep’t of the Army,\n No. SF-0752-18-0039-C-1, 2020 WL 231243 (M.S.P.B.\n Jan. 7, 2020) (P.A. 1–19) (Final Decision). 1 We have juris-\n diction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(9). We affirm-in-\n part, reverse-in-part, and remand.\n                        BACKGROUND\n     During the relevant time period, Mr. Foster was em-\n ployed by the Army in the position of Lead Firefighter, GS-\n 0081-08, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. Fos-\n ter v. Dep’t of the Army, No. SF-0752-18-0039-I-1, 2018\n WL 2762189 (M.S.P.B. June 4, 2018) (Cancellation Or-\n der). 2 In September 2017, the Army decided to remove Mr.\n Foster, effective October 1, 2017, “based on a charge of con-\n duct unbecoming of a Federal employee[,]” specifically,\n “making an anti-Semitic comment[.]” Id. Mr. Foster re-\n tired in lieu of removal, and subsequently filed an appeal\n\n\n\n\n     1    In keeping with the parties’ naming of the appen-\n dices, “P.A.” refers to the appendix attached to Mr. Foster’s\n informal brief; “S.A.” refers to the appendix attached to the\n Army’s informal response brief; and “S.P.A.” refers to the\n supplemental appendix attached to Mr. Foster’s informal\n reply brief.\n     2    Neither Mr. Foster nor the Army included the\n MSPB’s Cancellation Order in their respective appendices.\n See generally P.A.; S.A.; S.P.A. Accordingly, we cite to the\n publicly available version, which is unpaginated.\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28     Page: 3     Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v. ARMY                                               3\n\n\n\n with the MSPB. Id. 3 In June 2018, the MSPB administra-\n tive judge (“AJ”) issued the Cancellation Order reversing\n Mr. Foster’s removal based on a due process violation, and\n ordered the Army to: (1) cancel Mr. Foster’s removal and\n “retroactively restore [him] effective September 30, 2017”;\n (2) pay Mr. Foster “the appropriate amount of back[]pay,\n with interest[,] and to adjust benefits with appropriate\n credits and deductions in accordance with the Office of Per-\n sonnel Management’s regulations no later than [sixty] cal-\n endar days after the date [the Cancellation Order] becomes\n final”; and (3) “inform [Mr. Foster] in writing of all actions\n taken to comply with the [MSPB’s] [Cancellation] Order[.]”\n Id. The Cancellation Order became final on July 9, 2018.\n Id. 4\n     After cancelling Mr. Foster’s removal, on Septem-\n ber 14, 2018, the Army removed Mr. Foster for a second\n time, and the MSPB subsequently sustained this removal.\n P.A. 2. In October 2018, Mr. Foster filed a PFE of the\n MSPB’s Cancellation Order reversing his first removal, ar-\n guing that the Army was not in compliance with the\n\n\n     3    Though the record is unclear as to the effective date\n of his retirement, see P.A. 2 (stating only that Mr. Foster’s\n “October 1, 2017 retirement” “preceded the effective date of\n the retirement”), Mr. Foster does not challenge the MSPB’s\n treatment of October 1, 2017 as the effective date of his re-\n tirement. See generally Pet’r’s Informal Br.\n      4   The Cancellation Order became final on July 9,\n 2018, when neither Mr. Foster nor the Army filed a petition\n for review by that date. See 5 C.F.R. § 1201.113 (providing\n that “[t]he initial decision of the judge will become the\n [MSPB’s] final decision [thirty-five] days after issuance”\n unless, inter alia, “(a) . . . any party files a petition for re-\n view”); see also Foster, 2018 WL 2762189 (‘This initial de-\n cision will become final on July 9, 2018, unless a petition\n for review is filed by that date.”).\n\fCase: 20-1691    Document: 28      Page: 4    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                            FOSTER   v. ARMY\n\n\n\n Cancellation Order because Mr. Foster was still “in a\n [Leave Without Pay] status” and had not been paid any\n backpay. S.A. 47; see S.A. 43–48 (Petition for Enforce-\n ment). In May 2019, the Army paid Mr. Foster $17,459.97,\n reflecting $43,336.65 in gross backpay, offset by $25,876.68\n in deductions for retirement, income tax, investment, and\n healthcare premiums. P.A. 53; S.A. 320. The parties sub-\n mitted briefs on the PFE and engaged in mediation, which\n ended unsuccessfully in July 2019. S.A. 75–76, 125–27,\n 134–37. On August 23, 2019, the AJ ordered the Army “to\n file an updated written response” to Mr. Foster’s PFE,\n “show[ing] proof that [the Army] has complied with the\n [MSPB]’s [Cancellation Order], or that it has good cause for\n noncompliance[.]” S.A. 139. On October 2, 2019, the Army\n submitted an Agency Final Accounting and Supplemental\n to Agency PFE Response, S.P.A. 5–7, and the AJ closed the\n record on December 9, 2019, P.A. 3.\n      In January 2020, the AJ issued an initial decision. See\n P.A. 1. The AJ found that “although the [Army] was not in\n compliance with the [Cancellation] Order when [Mr. Fos-\n ter] filed his PFE,” it had since “submitted satisfactory ev-\n idence of compliance with its obligations to cancel [Mr.\n Foster]’s removal and retroactively restore him to his posi-\n tion until he was subsequently removed; and pay [him] the\n correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other\n benefits due.” P.A. 11. Accordingly, the AJ denied Mr. Fos-\n ter’s PFE, id., and the initial decision became final in Feb-\n ruary 2020. 5\n                         DISCUSSION\n     The MSPB concluded that the Army had submitted sat-\n isfactory evidence of compliance with its Cancellation\n\n\n     5   The AJ’s initial decision became the final decision\n of the MSPB on February 11, 2020, when neither Mr. Fos-\n ter nor the Army filed a petition for review by that date.\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28     Page: 5     Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v. ARMY                                               5\n\n\n\n Order as to the backpay paid to Mr. Foster, including the\n appropriateness of various deductions and recoupments for\n overpayments. P.A. 4–11. Mr. Foster challenges the\n MSPB’s findings as to: (1) owed gross backpay and over-\n time, and deductions for health insurance and retirement\n benefits; and (2) payment of the appropriate uniform allow-\n ance, as unsupported by substantial evidence. Pet’r’s In-\n formal Br. 4–8. We address each argument in turn.\n          I. Standard of Review and Legal Standard\n      We “hold unlawful and set aside” an MSPB decision\n that is: “(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or\n otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without\n procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been\n followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence[.]” 5\n U.S.C. § 7703(c). “The MSPB abuses its discretion when[,]”\n inter alia, “the decision is based on . . . factual findings that\n are not supported by substantial evidence[.]” Tartaglia v.\n Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 858 F.3d 1405, 1407–08 (Fed.\n Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n “Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evi-\n dence, but less than the weight of the evidence[.]” Jones v.\n Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 834 F.3d 1361, 1366\n (Fed. Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citations\n omitted). “Under the substantial evidence standard, this\n court reverses the [MSPB]’s decision only if it is not sup-\n ported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind\n might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.”\n Shapiro v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 800 F.3d 1332, 1336 (Fed.\n Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\n ted). “The petitioner bears the burden of establishing error\n in the MSPB’s decision.” Jenkins v. Merit Sys. Prot.\n Bd., 911 F.3d 1370, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (alterations omit-\n ted).\n     As is relevant here, “the purpose of . . . a cancellation\n order is to place the employee as nearly as possible in the\n status quo ante”—that is, the position the employee would\n have been in, but for the wrongful agency action. Kerr v.\n\fCase: 20-1691     Document: 28     Page: 6    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                             FOSTER   v. ARMY\n\n\n\n Nat’l Endowment for the Arts, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed.\n Cir. 1984); see Smith v. Dep’t of Army, 458 F.3d 1359, 1364\n (Fed. Cir. 2006) (“The [MSPB]’s enforcement power . . .\n functions to ensure that employees are returned to the sta-\n tus quo ante upon reversal of the agency’s action.”). This\n includes “compensation for any loss of wages or benefits\n that [the employee] suffered by reason of [the wrongful\n agency action].” Marshall v. Dep’t of Health & Human\n Servs., 587 F.3d 1310, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Compliance\n with a cancellation order is a question of fact, which we re-\n view for substantial evidence. See id.\n     Regarding computation of owed backpay, OPM regula-\n tions provide, in relevant part, that an agency “must” offset\n a gross backpay award by “[a]ny erroneous payments re-\n ceived from the Government as a result of the unjusti-\n fied . . . personnel action,” including “[r]etirement annuity\n payments[.]” 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2). The agency must\n also deduct payments “of the type that would have been\n made from the employee’s pay[,]” including, inter alia,\n “Medicare taxes[,]” “Federal income tax withholdings[,]”\n “health benefits premiums,” and “[m]andatory employee\n retirement contributions towards a defined benefit plan[.]”\n Id. § 550.805(e)(3).\n        II. Substantial Evidence Supports the MSPB’s\n Finding that the Army Complied with the MSPB’s Cancel-\n                lation Order as to Backpay\n    The MSPB found that the Army had complied with the\n Cancellation Order by paying Mr. Foster the appropriate\n amount of backpay and interest, including deductions for\n health insurance and retirement benefits he had received.\n P.A. 5–6. 6 Mr. Foster argues that the Army failed to\n\n\n\n\n     6   As Mr. Foster chose to retire in lieu of removal, Fos-\n ter, 2018 WL 2762189, he received retirement benefits.\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28   Page: 7   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v. ARMY                                          7\n\n\n\n provide a sufficient explanation for its gross backpay cal-\n culations and retirement deductions, improperly deducted\n health insurance premiums, and should have paid him\n overtime. Pet’r’s Informal Br. 4–8. We disagree with\n Mr. Foster.\n      Substantial evidence supports the MSPB’s finding that\n the Army paid Mr. Foster the appropriate backpay for the\n period from October 1, 2017 to September 14, 2018, the\n dates of Mr. Foster’s first and second removals. First, the\n Defense Finance and Accounting Service (“DFAS”) calcu-\n lated the gross backpay Mr. Foster would have earned from\n October 1, 2017, to August 30, 2018. S.A. 322–24 (Back\n Pay Computation Summary Report); see S.A. 258–59 (de-\n tailing, inter alia, Mr. Foster’s “Pay Plan[,]”\n “Grade/Level[,]” “Step/Rate[,]” and “Total Salary” for the\n relevant period). Next, DFAS then added compensation for\n “[i]nterest on [b]ack [p]ay” and “[a]nnual [l]eave[.]”\n S.A. 320–21, 330–31. The record supports DFAS’s decision\n not to compensate Mr. Foster for “irregular overtime”\n hours he hypothetically could have worked during the\n backpay period, as he did not volunteer for any irregular\n overtime for the two-year period prior to his first removal.\n S.A. 3551 (providing that “Mr. Foster did not work . . . any\n irregular overtime hours” from October 1, 2015 to Septem-\n ber 30, 2017). Next, DFAS deducted retirement benefits\n the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”) had paid Mr.\n Foster during the relevant period. S.A. 320–21; see S.A.\n 282 (detailing the retirement benefits paid to Mr. Foster\n “from 10/01/2017 thru 08/30/2018”). Finally, DFAS de-\n ducted further retirement, income tax, insurance, and in-\n vestment contributions that Mr. Foster would have paid,\n had his first removal not occurred. S.A. 320 (detailing de-\n ductions for, inter alia, “Medicare[,]” “Federal Income\n\n\n\n P.A. 55–62 (detailing annuity payments paid to Mr. Fos-\n ter).\n\fCase: 20-1691     Document: 28     Page: 8    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                             FOSTER   v.

Accordingly, sub-\n stantial evidence supports the MSPB’s finding that the\n Army “demonstrated it properly paid [Mr. Foster] the\n amount of backpay due him as a result of” the MSPB’s Can-\n cellation Order. P.A. 4.\n     Mr. Foster’s primary counterargument is unpersua-\n sive. Mr. Foster contends that the Army should not have\n deducted health insurance premiums from his backpay\n award because, subsequent to the MSPB’s Cancellation Or-\n der, he indicated to DFAS that he did not wish to have his\n health insurance reinstated during the backpay period.\n Pet’r’s Informal Br. 5; see P.A. 29–30 (Employee Statement\n Relative to Back Pay). Mr. Foster is incorrect. As noted,\n OPM regulations require that an agency offset a backpay\n award by “erroneous payments,” such as “[h]ealth benefits\n premiums, if coverage continued during a period of errone-\n ous retirement.” 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2), (3)(iii). Here, the\n record establishes that Mr. Foster received at least several\n months of health benefits during his “erroneous retire-\n ment.”      P.A. 57–62 (detailing deductions for “Blue\n Cross/Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan” premiums from\n February 2018 to July 2018). Thus, deduction of the health\n insurance premiums from the backpay award was con-\n sistent with OPM’s regulations, despite Mr. Foster’s later\n statement to DFAS that he did not wish to have health in-\n surance reinstated. Accordingly, substantial evidence sup-\n ports the MSPB’s finding that the Army paid Mr. Foster\n the proper amount of backpay. 7\n\n\n\n     7  The Army argues that “the MSPB did not need to\n reach whether the [Army] could deduct health insurance\n premiums contrary to Mr. Foster’s election because the\n [Army] did not make such deductions.” Resp’s Informal Br.\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28   Page: 9    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v. ARMY                                           9\n\n\n\n      II. Substantial Evidence Does Not Support the\n    MSPB’s Finding that the Army Complied with the\n   MSPB’s Cancellation Order as to Uniform Allowance\n     The MSPB concluded that Mr. Foster was only entitled\n to a $400 semi-annual uniform allowance, and that the\n Army had “produced sufficient evidence to establish” that\n it had complied with the Cancellation Order by paying\n Mr. Foster this uniform allowance. P.A. 9. Mr. Foster chal-\n lenges these findings as unsupported by substantial evi-\n dence. See Pet’r’s Informal Br. 7. Specifically, Mr. Foster\n argues that he “should have been treated as a new hire\n with full initial uniform allowance benefits of $1,600.00”\n because the “record . . . does not refute or dispute” that he\n “was required by the Army to turn in his uniforms and\n safety equipment[.]” Id. (alterations omitted). We agree\n with Mr. Foster.\n     The MSPB’s finding that the Army had paid Mr. Foster\n an appropriate uniform allowance is unsupported by sub-\n stantial evidence. Indeed, there is no evidence in the rec-\n ord to support the conclusion that the Army has paid\n Mr. Foster a uniform allowance. See generally S.A. 320–\n 21, 322–24, 331–32. In fact, the Army concedes that it has\n never paid Mr. Foster a uniform allowance for the relevant\n\n\n\n 16, n.4. The Army contends that, through a rather convo-\n luted process of payments and recoupments, it “honored\n Mr. Foster’s election” and ultimately did not deduct health\n insurance premiums from his backpay. See id. at 16–17.\n Because the Army does not appear to have raised this ar-\n gument before the MSPB, see generally P.A. 5–6, we will\n not consider it for the first time on appeal. Bosley v. Merit\n Sys. Prot. Bd., 162 F.3d 665, 668 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“A party\n in an MSPB proceeding must raise an issue before the ad-\n ministrative judge” if the issue is “to be preserved for re-\n view in this court.”).\n\fCase: 20-1691    Document: 28     Page: 10   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                           FOSTER   v. ARMY\n\n\n\n period. See Resp’s Informal Br. 19–20 (“The MSPB did,\n however, make a misstatement [concerning the uniform al-\n lowance] . . . because the payment was still underway at\n the time of the [Army’s] November 27, 2019[,] filing and no\n subsequent proof of payment was provided.”), 20–21 (ex-\n plaining that the Army has not paid Mr. Foster the uniform\n allowance “[b]ecause Mr. Foster never provided the neces-\n sary form”). Accordingly, the MSPB’s finding that the\n Army paid Mr. Foster the appropriate uniform allowance\n was unsupported by substantial evidence.\n     The MSPB’s finding that Mr. Foster is only entitled to\n a $400 semi-annual uniform allowance is also unsupported\n by substantial evidence. The MSPB premised this finding\n on its reasoning that Mr. Foster was “entitled to that which\n he would have received if he had remained employed with\n the [Army] until” his second removal, which “would not in-\n clude an initial uniform allowance.” P.A. 9. However,\n Mr. Foster argued before the MSPB that he should have\n received the full initial uniform allowance because he “was\n required to turn in his uniforms and safety equipment\n upon his separation[.]” P.A. 120. It is unclear from the\n record whether the Army required Mr. Foster to return his\n uniforms and equipment, and, if so, whether such items be-\n long to the civilian employee or whether they are Army\n property and routinely returned at the end of employment.\n See generally P.A.; S.A.; S.P.A. The MSPB’s Final Decision\n contains no analysis or fact-finding concerning these ques-\n tions. See generally P.A. 9 (stating only that Mr. Foster\n sought the $1,600 initial uniform allowance “because he\n was subject to an unjustified and unwarranted personnel\n action”). Accordingly, the record as it stands now, does not\n contain substantial evidence supporting the MSPB’s find-\n ing that Mr. Foster was entitled only to a $400 semi-annual\n uniform allowance.\n    The question of what uniform allowance would place\n Mr. Foster in the position he would have been in, prior to\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28   Page: 11   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v. ARMY                                         11\n\n\n\n his first removal, depends upon the results of additional\n fact-finding. We remand, so that the MSPB may allow the\n parties to submit evidence on whether the Army required\n Mr. Foster to return his uniforms and equipment, and if so,\n whether this is standard procedure in such situations or\n whether these items are regarded as the employee’s prop-\n erty, in order to determine the uniform allowance neces-\n sary to place Mr. Foster in status quo ante.\n                          CONCLUSION\n     We have considered the parties’ remaining arguments\n and find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the MSPB’s Fi-\n nal Decision is affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part. The\n case is remanded to the MSPB for further proceedings con-\n sistent with this opinion.\n   AFFIRMED-IN-PART, REVERSED-IN-PART, AND\n                 REMANDED\n                             COSTS\n     No costs.\n\f",

We disagree with\n Mr. Foster.\n      Substantial evidence supports the MSPB’s finding that\n the Army paid Mr. Foster the appropriate backpay for the\n period from October 1, 2017 to September 14, 2018, the\n dates of Mr. Foster’s first and second removals. First, the\n Defense Finance and Accounting Service (“DFAS”) calcu-\n lated the gross backpay Mr. Foster would have earned from\n October 1, 2017, to August 30, 2018. S.A. 322–24 (Back\n Pay Computation Summary Report); see S.A. 258–59 (de-\n tailing, inter alia, Mr. Foster’s “Pay Plan[,]”\n “Grade/Level[,]” “Step/Rate[,]” and “Total Salary” for the\n relevant period). Next, DFAS then added compensation for\n “[i]nterest on [b]ack [p]ay” and “[a]nnual [l]eave[.]”\n S.A. 320–21, 330–31. The record supports DFAS’s decision\n not to compensate Mr. Foster for “irregular overtime”\n hours he hypothetically could have worked during the\n backpay period, as he did not volunteer for any irregular\n overtime for the two-year period prior to his first removal.\n S.A. 3551 (providing that “Mr. Foster did not work . . . any\n irregular overtime hours” from October 1, 2015 to Septem-\n ber 30, 2017). Next, DFAS deducted retirement benefits\n the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”) had paid Mr.\n Foster during the relevant period. S.A. 320–21; see S.A.\n 282 (detailing the retirement benefits paid to Mr. Foster\n “from 10/01/2017 thru 08/30/2018”). Finally, DFAS de-\n ducted further retirement, income tax, insurance, and in-\n vestment contributions that Mr. Foster would have paid,\n had his first removal not occurred. S.A. 320 (detailing de-\n ductions for, inter alia, “Medicare[,]” “Federal Income\n\n\n\n P.A. 55–62 (detailing annuity payments paid to Mr. Fos-\n ter).\n\fCase: 20-1691     Document: 28     Page: 8    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                             FOSTER   v. ARMY\n\n\n\n Tax[,]” “Dental Insurance[,]” and a Thrift Savings Plan).\n The above deductions are required by OPM regulations.\n See 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2)(i)–(3)(v). Accordingly, sub-\n stantial evidence supports the MSPB’s finding that the\n Army “demonstrated it properly paid [Mr. Foster] the\n amount of backpay due him as a result of” the MSPB’s Can-\n cellation Order. P.A. 4.\n     Mr. Foster’s primary counterargument is unpersua-\n sive. Mr. Foster contends that the Army should not have\n deducted health insurance premiums from his backpay\n award because, subsequent to the MSPB’s Cancellation Or-\n der, he indicated to DFAS that he did not wish to have his\n health insurance reinstated during the backpay period.\n Pet’r’s Informal Br. 5; see P.A. 29–30 (Employee Statement\n Relative to Back Pay). Mr. Foster is incorrect. As noted,\n OPM regulations require that an agency offset a backpay\n award by “erroneous payments,” such as “[h]ealth benefits\n premiums, if coverage continued during a period of errone-\n ous retirement.” 5 C.F.R. § 550.805(e)(2), (3)(iii). Here, the\n record establishes that Mr. Foster received at least several\n months of health benefits during his “erroneous retire-\n ment.”      P.A. 57–62 (detailing deductions for “Blue\n Cross/Blue Shield Service Benefit Plan” premiums from\n February 2018 to July 2018). Thus, deduction of the health\n insurance premiums from the backpay award was con-\n sistent with OPM’s regulations, despite Mr. Foster’s later\n statement to DFAS that he did not wish to have health in-\n surance reinstated. Accordingly, substantial evidence sup-\n ports the MSPB’s finding that the Army paid Mr. Foster\n the proper amount of backpay. 7\n\n\n\n     7  The Army argues that “the MSPB did not need to\n reach whether the [Army] could deduct health insurance\n premiums contrary to Mr. Foster’s election because the\n [Army] did not make such deductions.” Resp’s Informal Br.\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28   Page: 9    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v.

Substantial Evidence Does Not Support the\n    MSPB’s Finding that the Army Complied with the\n   MSPB’s Cancellation Order as to Uniform Allowance\n     The MSPB concluded that Mr. Foster was only entitled\n to a $400 semi-annual uniform allowance, and that the\n Army had “produced sufficient evidence to establish” that\n it had complied with the Cancellation Order by paying\n Mr. Foster this uniform allowance. P.A. 9. Mr. Foster chal-\n lenges these findings as unsupported by substantial evi-\n dence. See Pet’r’s Informal Br. 7. Specifically, Mr. Foster\n argues that he “should have been treated as a new hire\n with full initial uniform allowance benefits of $1,600.00”\n because the “record . . . does not refute or dispute” that he\n “was required by the Army to turn in his uniforms and\n safety equipment[.]”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (alterations omitted). We </span><pre class=\"inline\">agree\n with Mr. Foster.\n     The MSPB’s finding that the Army had paid Mr. Foster\n an appropriate uniform allowance is unsupported by sub-\n stantial evidence. Indeed, there is no evidence in the rec-\n ord to support the conclusion that the Army has paid\n Mr. Foster a uniform allowance. See generally S.A. 320–\n 21, 322–24, 331–32. In fact, the Army concedes that it has\n never paid Mr. Foster a uniform allowance for the relevant\n\n\n\n 16, n.4.

Cir. 1998) (“A party\n in an MSPB proceeding must raise an issue before the ad-\n ministrative judge” if the issue is “to be preserved for re-\n view in this court.”).\n\fCase: 20-1691    Document: 28     Page: 10   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                           FOSTER   v. ARMY\n\n\n\n period. See Resp’s Informal Br. 19–20 (“The MSPB did,\n however, make a misstatement [concerning the uniform al-\n lowance] . . . because the payment was still underway at\n the time of the [Army’s] November 27, 2019[,] filing and no\n subsequent proof of payment was provided.”), 20–21 (ex-\n plaining that the Army has not paid Mr. Foster the uniform\n allowance “[b]ecause Mr. Foster never provided the neces-\n sary form”). Accordingly, the MSPB’s finding that the\n Army paid Mr. Foster the appropriate uniform allowance\n was unsupported by substantial evidence.\n     The MSPB’s finding that Mr. Foster is only entitled to\n a $400 semi-annual uniform allowance is also unsupported\n by substantial evidence. The MSPB premised this finding\n on its reasoning that Mr. Foster was “entitled to that which\n he would have received if he had remained employed with\n the [Army] until” his second removal, which “would not in-\n clude an initial uniform allowance.” P.A. 9. However,\n Mr. Foster argued before the MSPB that he should have\n received the full initial uniform allowance because he “was\n required to turn in his uniforms and safety equipment\n upon his separation[.]” P.A. 120. It is unclear from the\n record whether the Army required Mr. Foster to return his\n uniforms and equipment, and, if so, whether such items be-\n long to the civilian employee or whether they are Army\n property and routinely returned at the end of employment.\n See generally P.A.; S.A.; S.P.A. The MSPB’s Final Decision\n contains no analysis or fact-finding concerning these ques-\n tions. See generally P.A. 9 (stating only that Mr. Foster\n sought the $1,600 initial uniform allowance “because he\n was subject to an unjustified and unwarranted personnel\n action”). Accordingly, the record as it stands now, does not\n contain substantial evidence supporting the MSPB’s find-\n ing that Mr. Foster was entitled only to a $400 semi-annual\n uniform allowance.\n    The question of what uniform allowance would place\n Mr. Foster in the position he would have been in, prior to\n\fCase: 20-1691       Document: 28   Page: 11   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n FOSTER   v.

We remand, so that the MSPB may allow the\n parties to submit evidence on whether the Army required\n Mr. Foster to return his uniforms and equipment, and if so,\n whether this is standard procedure in such situations or\n whether these items are regarded as the employee’s prop-\n erty, in order to determine the uniform allowance neces-\n sary to place Mr. Foster in status quo ante.\n                          CONCLUSION\n     We have considered the parties’ remaining arguments\n and find them unpersuasive. Accordingly, the MSPB’s Fi-\n nal Decision is affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part.

Plaintiff-\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49      Page: 3    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v. US                                                3\n\n\n\n Appellant Nucor Corporation challenges Commerce’s final\n determination, raising two issues: first, whether Com-\n merce’s reliance on a preferential-rate standard to deter-\n mine whether a conferred benefit is a countervailable\n subsidy is contrary to law and, second, whether Com-\n merce’s determination that the Government of Korea did\n not confer a benefit to Korean producers of cold-rolled steel\n flat products for less than adequate remuneration is con-\n trary to law and unsupported by substantial evidence. We\n conclude that Commerce’s final determination is contrary\n to law and unsupported by substantial evidence. We va-\n cate and remand.\n                        BACKGROUND\n                A. Countervailable Subsidies\n      Foreign governments subsidize their domestic indus-\n tries when they provide financial assistance for the produc-\n tion, manufacture, or exportation of goods. 19 U.S.C.\n § 1677(5)(B). Generally, goods that have been provided\n countervailable subsidies are assessed countervailing du-\n ties upon their entry into the U.S. Customs territory.\n 19 U.S.C. § 1671(a). A subsidy becomes countervailable\n when an “authority,” or the government of a country or any\n public entity within the territory of the country, provides a\n financial contribution in the form of goods or services that\n results in a “benefit” conferred to the recipient. See\n § 1677(5)(B). The U.S. trade statute provides that a “ben-\n efit shall normally be treated as conferred” when those\n goods or services “are provided for less than adequate re-\n muneration.” § 1677(5)(E)(iv) (emphasis added). The stat-\n ute provides that Commerce determines the “less than\n adequate remuneration” question by evaluating “prevail-\n ing market conditions for the good or service being pro-\n vided” in the country that is subject to the investigation.\n § 1677(5)(E). Prevailing market conditions include “price,\n quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and\n other conditions of purchase or sale.” Id.\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49     Page: 4    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                                 POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n     When Congress enacted the Uruguay Round Agree-\n ments Act (“URAA”) in 1994, it changed the definition of\n what constitutes a benefit conferred. Pub. L. No. 103-465,\n § 101, 108 Stat. 4809, 4814 (codified as 19 U.S.C. § 3511).\n Prior to the enactment of the URAA, the statute provided\n that an authority conferred a benefit when it provided a\n good or service at a “preferential rate.” § 1677(5)(A)(ii)(II)\n (1988). “Preferential rate” means “more favorable to some\n within the relevant jurisdiction than to others within that\n jurisdiction.” 1 As a result of the Uruguay Round negotia-\n tions and subsequent enactment of the URAA, Congress\n amended the statute and changed the standard for deter-\n mining whether a benefit is conferred by expressly replac-\n ing “preferential rate” with “less than adequate\n remuneration.” See § 1677(5)(E)(iv). Specifically, the\n amended statute provides that “a benefit shall normally be\n treated as conferred” where in the case of goods or services,\n such services (here, electricity) “are provided for less than\n adequate remuneration.” Id. (emphasis added).\n     After enactment of the URAA, Commerce sought to de-\n velop a methodology for determining “adequacy of remu-\n neration.” 2 Commerce noted “[p]articular problems . . . in\n applying the [adequate-remuneration] standard when the\n government is the sole supplier of the good or service in the\n country or within the area where the respondent is\n\n\n\n     1   Certain Softwood Prods. from Canada, 48 Fed.\n Reg. 24,159, 24,167, 1983 WL 126683 (Dep’t of Commerce\n May 31, 1983) (final negative countervailing duty determi-\n nation) (Softwood from Canada).\n     2   Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 63 Fed. Reg.\n 65,348, 65,377 (Dep’t of Commerce Nov. 25, 1998) (CVD\n Preamble); see also Countervailing Duties: Proposed Rule,\n 62 Fed. Reg. 8,818 (Dep’t of Commerce Feb. 26, 1997) (no-\n tice of proposed rulemaking and request for public com-\n ments) (1997 Proposed Rule).\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49     Page: 5    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v. US                                                 5\n\n\n\n located.” 3 Commerce found that these problems arise be-\n cause “there may be no alternative market prices availa-\n ble” to use as a benchmark in its analysis. Steel Wire Rod\n from Trinidad and Tobago, 62 Fed. Reg. at 55,006. To ad-\n dress these problems, Commerce developed a three-tier\n methodology to evaluate adequacy of remuneration.\n 19 C.F.R. § 351.511. In Tier 1, Commerce compares the\n government price to a market-based price for the good or\n service under investigation in the country in question (a\n “Tier 1” analysis). § 351.511(a)(2)(i). When an in-country,\n market-based price is unavailable, Commerce will compare\n the government price to a world-market price if the world-\n market price is available to purchasers in the country in\n question (a “Tier 2” analysis). § 351.511(a)(2)(ii). When\n both an in-country, market-based price and a world-market\n price are unavailable, Commerce considers “whether the\n government price is consistent with market principles” (a\n “Tier 3” analysis). § 351.511(a)(2)(iii). Under a Tier 3 anal-\n ysis, if Commerce determines that government pricing is\n not consistent with market principles, then “a benefit shall\n normally be treated as conferred.”                19 U.S.C.\n § 1677(5)(E)(iv). Only Tier 3 is at issue in this appeal.\n                     B. The Investigation\n     On July 28, 2015, Commerce received requests for ini-\n tiation of countervailing duty (“CVD”) investigations on im-\n ports of certain cold-rolled steel flat products (“cold-rolled\n steel” or “CRS”) from several countries including the Re-\n public of Korea (“Korea”). See J.A. 1269. Countervailing\n duty petitions were filed on behalf of AK Steel Corporation,\n\n\n     3    Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago, 62 Fed.\n Reg. 55,003, 55,006–07 (Dep’t of Commerce Oct. 22, 1997)\n (final affirmative countervailing duty determination); Steel\n Wire Rod from Germany, 62 Fed. Reg. 54,990, 54,994 (Dep’t\n of Commerce Oct. 22, 1997) (final affirmative countervail-\n ing duty determination).\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49      Page: 6    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 6                                                POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n ArcelorMittal USA EEC, Nucor Corporation, Steel Dynam-\n ics, Inc., and United States Steel Corporation (collectively,\n “Petitioners”). See id. Petitioners alleged that the Govern-\n ment of Korea provided countervailable subsidies to Ko-\n rean producers of CRS, and that imports of CRS from\n Korea were materially injuring, or threatening material in-\n jury to, an industry in the United States. 4 J.A. 1269. Pe-\n titioners alleged, inter alia, that the Korean government\n conferred a specific benefit on Korean CRS producers\n through the provision of a good or service—electricity—for\n less than adequate remuneration. J.A. 353–76.\n      In August 2015, Commerce initiated a CVD investiga-\n tion on CRS from Korea. See J.A. 1269-1274; see also\n J.A. 109, J.A. 346-376. The period of investigation encom-\n passed January 1 to December 31, 2014. J.A. 1269. Com-\n merce selected POSCO and Hyundai Steel Co., Ltd., as\n mandatory “respondents” for the investigation.

Generally,\n Commerce determines whether any alleged subsidies are\n countervailable and the extent, if any, of applicable coun-\n tervailing duty rates. See 19 U.S.C. § 1671e(b) (Imposition\n of Duties); § 1677f-1(e) (Determination of Countervailable\n Subsidy Rate). The ITC investigation determines whether\n U.S. industry is materially injured, or threatened with ma-\n terial injury, by reason of imported goods that have been\n deemed subject to countervailing duty rates. See 19 U.S.C.\n § 1675b(a)(1) (Investigation by Commission Upon Re-\n quest). This appeal involves only the Commerce side of the\n investigation.\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49     Page: 7    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v. US                                                 7\n\n\n\n entity and the sole provider of electricity in Korea. J.A.\n 13075, J.A. 1293, J.A. 12769.\n     In its questionnaire responses, the Korean government\n explained that electricity is generated by “[i]ndependent\n power generators, community energy systems, and\n KEPCO’s six subsidiaries.” See J.A. 18. The Korean gov-\n ernment further explained that all electricity generated in\n Korea, including that of private generators, must be sold to\n KEPCO in a wholesale market known as the Korea Power\n Exchange (“KPX”), which is wholly owned by KEPCO and\n its six subsidiaries. J.A. 1300, J.A. 3137. KEPCO then\n sells electricity to end users based on a tariff schedule that\n provides different rates for classes of consumers including\n industrial, residential, agricultural, and business users.\n J.A. 4437-4449. The Korean government noted that the\n prices in KEPCO’s tariff schedule are established in con-\n sultation with other Korean-government agencies, through\n a “lengthy deliberative process” that seeks the approval of\n the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the Ministry\n of Strategy and Finance, and the Korea Energy Regulatory\n Commission. J.A. 1296, J.A. 3111. While KEPCO and\n other government entities establish the ultimate prices to\n end users, the basis of these prices is the cost of KEPCO’s\n purchases from the KPX. J.A. 13083. The Korean govern-\n ment reported in its questionnaire response that KPX is a\n wholly owned subsidiary of KEPCO and that all sales of\n electricity in Korea are administered by KPX. See J.A. 18\n n.17 (citing the Korean government’s questionnaire re-\n sponse, Ex. E-3 at 31); see also J.A. 3111 (Ex. E-3, KEPCO\n Form 20-F, explaining that KEPCO “wholly own[s]” KPX).\n     In its preliminary determination, Commerce found\n that KEPCO, through its six subsidiaries, generates the\n “substantial majority of the electricity produced in Korea.”\n J.A. 12769. Commerce found that the Korean government\n regulates and approves electricity tariffs charged by\n KEPCO. Id. Commerce further found that the Korean gov-\n ernment “exercises significant control over KEPCO\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49      Page: 8    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                                  POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n through its majority ownership and pursues government\n policy objectives through KEPCO’s business and opera-\n tions.” Id. Commerce therefore determined that KEPCO\n is an authority of the Korean government and that the Ko-\n rean government is providing to producers of CRS “a finan-\n cial contribution in the form of the provision of a good or\n service.” Id. To determine whether that financial contri-\n bution constitutes a “benefit,” Commerce conducted a\n Tier 3 analysis. J.A. 12772. In its analysis, Commerce\n started by considering KEPCO’s “price-setting philosophy”\n by analyzing “electricity rates charged to the respondents\n to determine whether the price charged is consistent with\n KEPCO’s standard pricing mechanism.” Id. Commerce\n considered KEPCO’s overall cost, including its “operational\n cost for generating and supplying electricity.” Id. Com-\n merce’s analysis then turned on whether respondents were\n given preferential treatment:\n     If the rate charged is consistent with the standard\n     pricing mechanism and the company under inves-\n     tigation is, in all other respects, essentially treated\n     no differently than other companies and industries\n     which purchase comparable amounts of electricity,\n     then there is no benefit.\n Id. (citing Pure Magnesium & Alloy Magnesium from Can-\n ada, 57 Fed. Reg. 30,946 (Dep’t Commerce July 13, 1992)\n (Magnesium from Canada)).\n      Commerce conducted verification of the Korean gov-\n ernment’s questionnaire responses in March 2016, but it\n did not verify the Korean government’s provision of elec-\n tricity for less than adequate remuneration.          See\n J.A. 13075. Rather, Commerce relied on the verification it\n previously conducted in its investigation of corrosion-re-\n sistant steel (“CORE”) from Korea, which is the subject of\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49      Page: 9    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v.

Cir. 2019). 5\n    In its Final Determination, Commerce determined that,\n “consistent with 19 § CFR 351.511 and Magnesium from\n Canada,” the Korean government provided respondents no\n benefit “because the prices charged to these respondents\n under the applicable industrial tariff were consistent with\n KEPCO’s standard pricing mechanism.” J.A. 13079 (Issue\n and Memorandum Decision accompanying Countervailing\n Duty Investigation of Certain Cold-Rolled Steel Flat Prod-\n ucts from the Republic of Korea, 81 Fed. Reg. 49,943 (Dep’t\n Commerce July 29, 2016) (final affirmative determination,\n 2014)). Commerce found no evidence in the record suggest-\n ing that that respondents received preferential treatment\n over other industrial users of electricity that purchase com-\n parable amounts of electricity. Id.\n    Commerce justified its reliance on a preferentiality\n standard despite the amendment of the Trade statute to\n replace preferential rate with adequate remuneration. J.A.\n 13079–80. Commerce opined that its regulations regard-\n ing the provision of a good or service, especially 19 C.F.R.\n § 351.511, were enacted as a result of the URAA and with\n reference to the methodology developed in Magnesium\n from Canada. Id. Commerce further reasoned that the\n CVD Preamble, which cites Magnesium from Canada, ref-\n erences “possible price discrimination” as one factor that\n the department may consider when assessing whether a\n government price is consistent with market principles.\n J.A. 13080. Commerce opined that the URAA’s move away\n from preferentiality merely “flipped the regulatory hierar-\n chy,” promoting in-country, market prices and world-\n\n\n     5    In Nucor, Commerce did not obtain from the Ko-\n rean government KPX’s cost of generating electricity.\n 927 F.3d at 1247–48. KPX’s costs were therefore not veri-\n fied in the Nucor investigation.\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49      Page: 10    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 10                                                POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n market prices over price discrimination—i.e., the creation\n of Tiers 1–3. Id. Commerce suggested that a price discrim-\n ination analysis alone may be sufficient to assess adequate\n remuneration. J.A. 13081.\n     Commerce also addressed Petitioners’ allegations that\n Commerce’s analysis of electricity tariffs failed to include\n the full cost of generation, including, e.g., electricity from\n nuclear-power generators. J.A. 13083. Petitioners alleged\n that CRS producers purchase electricity predominantly\n during off-hours when electricity is primarily generated\n from nuclear-generation units. See id. Commerce noted\n that it did not request information regarding costs to elec-\n tricity generators because the costs of electricity to KEPCO\n are determined by the KPX. Id. Commerce therefore found\n relevant only KEPCO’s purchase price from the KPX and\n not the costs underlying KPX’s price. Id. In particular,\n Commerce did not review quality, availability, marketabil-\n ity, transportation, or other conditions affecting KEPCO’s\n purchase or sale of electricity from KPX.\n    Nucor appealed Commerce’s final determination to the\n Trade Court. J.A. 13132-13181.\n            C. U.S. Court of International Trade\n     On appeal, Nucor argued that Commerce’s final deter-\n mination is unlawful for three reasons. First, Nucor con-\n tended that Commerce erred in using preferentiality to\n determine whether a benefit was conferred to Korean pro-\n ducers of CRS. J.A. 13154. Second, Nucor argued that\n Commerce unreasonably excluded cost recovery when in-\n terpreting “adequate remuneration.” J.A. 13160. Third,\n Nucor alleged that Commerce ignored arguments and evi-\n dence (e.g., that Commerce failed to account for KPX’s role\n in setting KEPCO’s tariff schedule) demonstrating that Ko-\n rean electricity-price setting does not follow market princi-\n ples. J.A. 13168-13174.\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49     Page: 11    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v.

This appeal ensued. We have jurisdiction under\n 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(5).\n                         DISCUSSION\n     We review decisions of the Trade Court de novo. Boom-\n erang Tube LLC v. United States, 856 F.3d 908, 912 (Fed.\n Cir. 2017). We apply the same standard of review used by\n the Trade Court in reviewing Commerce’s determinations.\n See 19 U.S.C. § 1516(a)(b)(1)(B); Union Steel v. United\n States, 713 F.3d 1101, 1106 (Fed. Cir. 2013). We therefore\n review Commerce’s final determination to assess whether\n it is supported by substantial evidence or otherwise con-\n trary to law. Union Steel, 713 F.3d at 1106.\n    We address two issues on appeal: first, whether Com-\n merce erred as a matter of law when it based its benefit-\n conferred analysis on a preferential-rate standard, and sec-\n ond, whether substantial evidence supports Commerce’s\n finding that the Korean government does not provide a\n countervailable subsidy to respondents. Because Com-\n merce’s final determination is unsupported by substantial\n evidence and contrary to law, we vacate and remand.\n                 A. Adequate Remuneration\n    Commerce failed to properly measure less-than-ade-\n quate remuneration under post-URAA principles.\n     In Nucor, we addressed essentially the same issues\n raised in this appeal, including Commerce’s reliance on the\n pre-URAA preferential-rate standard. 927 F.3d 1243. We\n rejected Commerce’s “broad theory” that “if the foreign gov-\n ernment authority engaged in a uniform, non-discrimina-\n tory, tariffed practice of charging a price so low that the\n authority consistently lost large sums of money in a way no\n private seller could sustain, sales pursuant to that practice\n would not be properly viewed as for ‘less than adequate\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49      Page: 12     Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12                                                   POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n remuneration.’” Id. at 1249. We concluded that the plain\n language of § 1677(5)(E), its context within the overall stat-\n utory scheme, its legislative history, and our related prec-\n edent did not support Commerce’s reliance on a\n preferential-rate standard. Id. at 1249–54. We held that\n Commerce’s “position is beyond any reasonable interpreta-\n tion of the statute, or of its implementation regulation.” Id.\n at 1249.\n     Our decision in Nucor issued on June 21, 2019, after the\n parties filed their briefs in this appeal. On June 26, 2019,\n Commerce filed a citation of supplemental authority advis-\n ing the court of the Nucor decision and explaining that\n “Nucor’s opening brief filed in this appeal is substantially\n identical to Nucor’s opening brief filed in [Nucor].” ECF\n No. 39. Commerce also explained that the Nucor decision\n “pertains to nearly the entirety of [its] brief filed in this ap-\n peal on March 29, 2019.” Id. In its response, Nucor clari-\n fied that the issue of “whether Commerce may lawfully\n apply an analysis of ‘preferential rates’ to measure ‘ade-\n quate remuneration’” is identical in both cases. ECF\n No. 40. We conclude that Commerce’s position on prefer-\n entiality here is identical to its position in Nucor and that\n our decision in Nucor rejecting Commerce’s use of the pref-\n erentiality standard applies to this appeal.\n    As in Nucor, Commerce’s use of the pre-URAA prefer-\n ential-rates standard in this case is inconsistent with the\n adequate-remuneration standard under § 1677(5)(E)(iv).\n Commerce cannot rely on price discrimination to the exclu-\n sion of a thorough evaluation of fair-market principles to\n determine whether a recipient is receiving an unlawful\n benefit. See Nucor, 927 F.3d at 1251 (reasoning that “the\n existence of a ‘benefit’ of an unjustifiably low price . . . can-\n not depend on [a] finding that the producer is being dis-\n criminatorily favored compared to others in the exporting\n country”).\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49     Page: 13   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v. US                                              13\n\n\n\n     In Nucor, we highlighted the Statement of Administra-\n tive Action, which provides that preferentiality be replaced\n with the new standard of less-than-adequate renumera-\n tion. 927 F.3d at 1252 (citing Uruguay Round Agreements\n Act, Statement of Administrative Action, H.R. Doc. No.\n 103–316, vol. 1, at 927 (1994) (“SAA”)). We noted that\n “[t]his authoritative interpretation confirms what the stat-\n utory language, in its ordinary and in-context meaning, en-\n tails. It makes clear that the new standard rests on a\n concept different from mere lack of preferentiality.” Id.\n Thus, the words used in the statute, understood in their\n ordinary sense, make it unreasonable that lack of discrim-\n ination is sufficient to establish adequacy of remuneration.\n See id. at 1250.\n    Consistent with our holding in Nucor, we hold that\n Commerce’s reliance on a preferential-rate standard is in-\n consistent with the Trade statute, in particular with the\n less-than-adequate-remuneration requirement, and is\n therefore contrary to law.\n                      B. Cost Recovery\n     Commerce’s cost-recovery analysis is limited to a dis-\n cussion of KEPCO’s costs. See J.A. 13081–83. The limited\n analysis does not support its conclusion that electricity\n prices paid to KEPCO by respondents are consistent with\n prevailing market conditions because Commerce failed to\n evaluate KPX’s impact on the Korean electricity market.\n     In Nucor, Plaintiff Nucor argued that Commerce erred\n by limiting the analysis to the prices that KEPCO charged\n in relation to its costs, which included the price paid to\n KPX, instead of considering the adequacy (less-than-ade-\n quate remuneration) of the prices that KPX charged in re-\n lation to its costs.. 927 F.3d at 1255. We agreed with the\n Trade Court’s determination that Nucor’s argument was,\n “in substance, a contention that KPX is part of KEPCO as\n the ‘authority’ whose prices Commerce had to analyze.” Id.\n The Trade Court, however, concluded that Nucor “failed to\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49     Page: 14    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14                                               POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n exhaust this argument at the agency level.” Id. As a result,\n the Trade Court affirmed Commerce’s final determination\n on this point. We agreed that Nucor failed to exhaust its\n KPX-related arguments and, as a result, our decision also\n did not address the KPX issue. Id.\n     In this appeal, Nucor again argues that Commerce\n erred by failing to consider KPX’s impact on KEPCO’s pric-\n ing. See Appellant Br. 36–47; see also J.A. 71–73 (Trade\n Court opinion rejecting Nucor’s argument); J.A. 12898–914\n (Nucor’s Case Brief to Commerce addressing KPX’s impact\n on KEPCO’s electricity pricing). The government does not\n raise an exhaustion argument in this case, and we conclude\n that Nucor preserved this issue for appeal. Cf. Novosteel\n SA v. United States, 284 F.3d 1261, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2002)\n (applying the waiver doctrine but explaining that a party\n preserves an issue for appeal where it exhausts that issue\n before an administrative agency “so as to give a court the\n proper basis to review that issue on appeal”).\n     Here, the administrative record does not support Com-\n merce’s determination that KEPCO is the only relevant en-\n tity for purposes of analyzing costs. J.A. 13083. To the\n contrary, evidence in the record suggests that KPX has a\n significant impact on KEPCO’s pricing, and that Com-\n merce failed to adequately investigate and consider KPX’s\n impact on the Korean electricity market. For example, the\n record shows that all electricity generated in Korea must\n be sold to KEPCO by KPX (J.A. 1300, 3137); KPX is wholly\n owned by KEPCO and its six electricity-generation subsid-\n iaries (id.); KEPCO bases its prices on the cost of its pur-\n chases from the KPX (see J.A. 13083); and KPX’s pricing\n accounts for upwards of 90% of KEPCO’s total cost (see Nu-\n cor, 927 F.3d at 1259 (Reyna, J., dissenting) (citing\n J.A. 8316, Letter from Yoon & Yang LLC to Sec’y Com-\n merce, re: Countervailing Duty Investigation: Certain Cor-\n rosion-Resistant Steel Products (CORE) from the Republic\n of Korea: Response to 2nd Supplemental Questionnaire\n (Oct. 15, 2015))).

Instead, Commerce determined that only the\n costs to KEPCO, not the costs associated with the genera-\n tors themselves, were relevant to price because KEPCO\n purchases electricity through KPX, which purchases from\n the generators. See J.A. 13083. Commerce’s determina-\n tion that KPX was not relevant to its analysis leaves unre-\n solved whether a benefit was conferred by way of the price\n charged by KPX to KEPCO. See § 1677-1; see also SAA at\n 927.\n     The government argues that “[n]othing in the statute\n requires Commerce to consider how the authority acquired\n the good or service that was later provided to respondents.”\n Appellee Br. 35 (citation and internal quotation marks\n omitted). We disagree. Commerce has an affirmative duty\n to investigate any appearance of subsidies related to the\n investigation that are discovered during an investigation.\n See 19 U.S.C. § 1677d; Allegheny Ludlum Corp. v. United\n States, 112 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1150 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2000).\n Section 1677(5) requires Commerce to evaluate subsidies\n “without regard to whether the subsidy is provided directly\n or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of\n merchandise,” and it requires Commerce to consider the\n adequacy of remuneration “in relation to prevailing market\n conditions.” § 1677(5)(C), (E). Here, Commerce failed to\n investigate an appearance of a potential subsidy that was\n disclosed during the investigation within the Korean\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49     Page: 16    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16                                               POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n government’s own questionnaire responses. See 19 U.S.C.\n § 1677d.\n     The government’s argument assumes that KPX is not,\n itself, an authority of the Korean government. That as-\n sumption, however, is unsupported by the evidence. Under\n § 1677(5)(B)(iii), an authority is defined as “a government\n of a country or any public entity within the territory of the\n country.” In Guangdong Wireking Housewares & Hard-\n ware Co. v. United States, the Trade Court affirmed Com-\n merce’s      determination      that     certain     wire-rod\n manufacturers under investigation were authorities under\n § 1677(5)(b) where the government of China held a major-\n ity ownership position in those wire-rod manufacturers.\n 900 F. Supp. 2d 1362, 1376–78 (Ct. Int’l Trade 2013). The\n court explained that § 1677(5)(B)’s “public entity” provision\n includes entities that are majority owned by a government\n and it relied on “Commerce’s longstanding practice of treat-\n ing most government-owned corporations as the govern-\n ment itself.” Id. at 1376–77 (internal quotation marks\n omitted). Here, the Korean government’s questionnaire re-\n sponse clarifies that KPX is a wholly owned subsidiary of\n KEPCO. J.A. 3111. There is no dispute that KEPCO is a\n state-owned entity and the sole provider of electricity in\n Korea. This evidence strongly suggests that KPX, like\n KEPCO, is an authority under § 1677(5)(B). Commerce\n disregarded this evidence when it assumed that it ade-\n quately accounted for KPX via the price paid by KEPCO.\n KPX is an authority. And Commerce’s failure to treat KPX\n as an authority—or, at a minimum, investigate whether it\n is an authority—constitutes error as a matter of law. Be-\n cause the role of KPX in the Korean electricity market re-\n mains unaddressed, Commerce’s final determination is not\n supported by substantial evidence.\n                        CONCLUSION\n    We have considered the government’s remaining argu-\n ments and find them unpersuasive. Because Commerce\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49     Page: 17    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v.

In addition,\n Commerce’s failure to investigate and include KPX’s gen-\n eration costs in its analysis renders its final determination\n unsupported by substantial evidence.

The Trade Court affirmed the U.S. Depart-\n ment of Commerce’s final affirmative determination in the\n countervailing duty investigation on certain cold-rolled\n steel flat products from the Republic of Korea. Plaintiff-\n\fCase: 19-1213    Document: 49      Page: 3    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v. US                                                3\n\n\n\n Appellant Nucor Corporation challenges Commerce’s final\n determination, raising two issues: first, whether Com-\n merce’s reliance on a preferential-rate standard to deter-\n mine whether a conferred benefit is a countervailable\n subsidy is contrary to law and, second, whether Com-\n merce’s determination that the Government of Korea did\n not confer a benefit to Korean producers of cold-rolled steel\n flat products for less than adequate remuneration is con-\n trary to law and unsupported by substantial evidence. We\n conclude that Commerce’s final determination is contrary\n to law and unsupported by substantial evidence. We va-\n cate and remand.\n                        BACKGROUND\n                A. Countervailable Subsidies\n      Foreign governments subsidize their domestic indus-\n tries when they provide financial assistance for the produc-\n tion, manufacture, or exportation of goods. 19 U.S.C.\n § 1677(5)(B). Generally, goods that have been provided\n countervailable subsidies are assessed countervailing du-\n ties upon their entry into the U.S. Customs territory.\n 19 U.S.C. § 1671(a). A subsidy becomes countervailable\n when an “authority,” or the government of a country or any\n public entity within the territory of the country, provides a\n financial contribution in the form of goods or services that\n results in a “benefit” conferred to the recipient. See\n § 1677(5)(B). The U.S. trade statute provides that a “ben-\n efit shall normally be treated as conferred” when those\n goods or services “are provided for less than adequate re-\n muneration.” § 1677(5)(E)(iv) (emphasis added). The stat-\n ute provides that Commerce determines the “less than\n adequate remuneration” question by evaluating “prevail-\n ing market conditions for the good or service being pro-\n vided” in the country that is subject to the investigation.\n § 1677(5)(E). Prevailing market conditions include “price,\n quality, availability, marketability, transportation, and\n other conditions of purchase or sale.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: </span><pre class=\"inline\">49     Page: 4    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 4                                                 POSCO v. US\n\n\n\n\n     When Congress enacted the Uruguay Round Agree-\n ments Act (“URAA”) in 1994, it changed the definition of\n what constitutes a benefit conferred. Pub. L. No. 103-465,\n § 101, 108 Stat. 4809, 4814 (codified as 19 U.S.C. § 3511).\n Prior to the enactment of the URAA, the statute provided\n that an authority conferred a benefit when it provided a\n good or service at a “preferential rate.” § 1677(5)(A)(ii)(II)\n (1988). “Preferential rate” means “more favorable to some\n within the relevant jurisdiction than to others within that\n jurisdiction.” 1 As a result of the Uruguay Round negotia-\n tions and subsequent enactment of the URAA, Congress\n amended the statute and changed the standard for deter-\n mining whether a benefit is conferred by expressly replac-\n ing “preferential rate” with “less than adequate\n remuneration.” See § 1677(5)(E)(iv). Specifically, the\n amended statute provides that “a benefit shall normally be\n treated as conferred” where in the case of goods or services,\n such services (here, electricity) “are provided for less than\n adequate remuneration.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (emphasis added).\n     After </span><pre class=\"inline\">enactment of the URAA, Commerce sought to de-\n velop a methodology for determining “adequacy of remu-\n neration.” 2 Commerce noted “[p]articular problems . . . in\n applying the [adequate-remuneration] standard when the\n government is the sole supplier of the good or service in the\n country or within the area where the respondent is\n\n\n\n     1   Certain Softwood Prods. from Canada, 48 Fed.\n Reg. 24,159, 24,167, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">126683</span> </span><pre class=\"inline\">(Dep’t of Commerce\n May 31, 1983) (final negative countervailing duty determi-\n nation) (Softwood from Canada).\n     2   Countervailing Duties: Final Rule, 63 Fed.

Steel Wire Rod\n from Trinidad and Tobago, 62 Fed. Reg. at 55,006. To ad-\n dress these problems, Commerce developed a three-tier\n methodology to evaluate adequacy of remuneration.\n 19 C.F.R. § 351.511. In Tier 1, Commerce compares the\n government price to a market-based price for the good or\n service under investigation in the country in question (a\n “Tier 1” analysis). § 351.511(a)(2)(i). When an in-country,\n market-based price is unavailable, Commerce will compare\n the government price to a world-market price if the world-\n market price is available to purchasers in the country in\n question (a “Tier 2” analysis). § 351.511(a)(2)(ii). When\n both an in-country, market-based price and a world-market\n price are unavailable, Commerce considers “whether the\n government price is consistent with market principles” (a\n “Tier 3” analysis). § 351.511(a)(2)(iii). Under a Tier 3 anal-\n ysis, if Commerce determines that government pricing is\n not consistent with market principles, then “a benefit shall\n normally be treated as conferred.”                19 U.S.C.\n § 1677(5)(E)(iv). Only Tier 3 is at issue in this appeal.\n                     B. The Investigation\n     On July 28, 2015, Commerce received requests for ini-\n tiation of countervailing duty (“CVD”) investigations on im-\n ports of certain cold-rolled steel flat products (“cold-rolled\n steel” or “CRS”) from several countries including the Re-\n public of Korea (“Korea”). See J.A. 1269.

See</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span> Petitioners alleged that </span><pre class=\"inline\">the Govern-\n ment of Korea provided countervailable subsidies to Ko-\n rean producers of CRS, and that imports of CRS from\n Korea were materially injuring, or threatening material in-\n jury to, an industry in the United States. 4 J.A. 1269. Pe-\n titioners alleged, inter alia, that the Korean government\n conferred a specific benefit on Korean CRS producers\n through the provision of a good or service—electricity—for\n less than adequate remuneration. J.A. 353–76.\n      In August 2015, Commerce initiated a CVD investiga-\n tion on CRS from Korea. See J.A. 1269-1274; see also\n J.A. 109, J.A. 346-376. The period of investigation encom-\n passed January 1 to December 31, 2014. J.A. 1269. Com-\n merce selected POSCO and Hyundai Steel Co., Ltd., as\n mandatory “respondents” for the investigation. J.A. 13034.\n Commerce issued questionnaires requesting that the Ko-\n rean government provide information about the Korean\n electricity industry and market, including the Korea Elec-\n tric Power Corporation (“KEPCO”), which is a state-owned\n\n\n\n     4    Under U.S. trade law, countervailing duty investi-\n gations are concurrently conducted by Commerce and the\n U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Generally,\n Commerce determines whether any alleged subsidies are\n countervailable and the extent, if any, of applicable coun-\n tervailing duty rates. See 19 U.S.C. § 1671e(b) (Imposition\n of Duties); § 1677f-1(e) (Determination of Countervailable\n Subsidy Rate). The ITC investigation determines whether\n U.S. industry is materially injured, or threatened with ma-\n terial injury, by reason of imported goods that have been\n deemed subject to countervailing duty rates. See 19 U.S.C.\n § 1675b(a)(1) (Investigation by Commission Upon Re-\n quest). This appeal involves only the Commerce side of the\n investigation.\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49     Page: 7    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n POSCO v.

J.A.\n 13075, J.A. 1293, J.A. 12769.\n     In its questionnaire responses, the Korean government\n explained that electricity is generated by “[i]ndependent\n power generators, community energy systems, and\n KEPCO’s six subsidiaries.” See J.A. 18. The Korean gov-\n ernment further explained that all electricity generated in\n Korea, including that of private generators, must be sold to\n KEPCO in a wholesale market known as the Korea Power\n Exchange (“KPX”), which is wholly owned by KEPCO and\n its six subsidiaries. J.A. 1300, J.A. 3137. KEPCO then\n sells electricity to end users based on a tariff schedule that\n provides different rates for classes of consumers including\n industrial, residential, agricultural, and business users.\n J.A. 4437-4449. The Korean government noted that the\n prices in KEPCO’s tariff schedule are established in con-\n sultation with other Korean-government agencies, through\n a “lengthy deliberative process” that seeks the approval of\n the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy, the Ministry\n of Strategy and Finance, and the Korea Energy Regulatory\n Commission. J.A. 1296, J.A. 3111. While KEPCO and\n other government entities establish the ultimate prices to\n end users, the basis of these prices is the cost of KEPCO’s\n purchases from the KPX. J.A. 13083. The Korean govern-\n ment reported in its questionnaire response that KPX is a\n wholly owned subsidiary of KEPCO and that all sales of\n electricity in Korea are administered by KPX. See J.A. 18\n n.17 (citing the Korean government’s questionnaire re-\n sponse, Ex. E-3 at 31); see also J.A. 3111 (Ex. E-3, KEPCO\n Form 20-F, explaining that KEPCO “wholly own[s]” KPX).\n     In its preliminary determination, Commerce found\n that KEPCO, through its six subsidiaries, generates the\n “substantial majority of the electricity produced in Korea.”\n J.A. 12769. Commerce found that the Korean government\n regulates and approves electricity tariffs charged by\n KEPCO.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Commerce further found </span><pre class=\"inline\">that the Korean gov-\n ernment “exercises significant control over KEPCO\n\fCase: 19-1213     Document: 49      Page: 8    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 8                                                  POSCO v.

J.A. 12772. In its analysis, Commerce\n started by considering KEPCO’s “price-setting philosophy”\n by analyzing “electricity rates charged to the respondents\n to determine whether the price charged is consistent with\n KEPCO’s standard pricing mechanism.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Commerce\n considered KEPCO’s </span><pre class=\"inline\">overall cost, including its “operational\n cost for generating and supplying electricity.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> Com-\n merce’s analysis </span><pre class=\"inline\">then turned on whether respondents were\n given preferential treatment:\n     If the rate charged is consistent with the standard\n     pricing mechanism and the company under inves-\n     tigation is, in all other respects, essentially treated\n     no differently than other companies and industries\n     which purchase comparable amounts of electricity,\n     then there is no benefit.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (citing Pure Magnesium </span><pre class=\"inline\">& Alloy Magnesium from Can-\n ada, 57 Fed.

Second, Nucor argued that\n Commerce unreasonably excluded cost recovery when in-\n terpreting “adequate remuneration.” J.A. 13160. Third,\n Nucor alleged that Commerce ignored arguments and evi-\n dence (e.g., that Commerce failed to account for KPX’s role\n in setting KEPCO’s tariff schedule) demonstrating that Ko-\n rean electricity-price setting does not follow market princi-\n ples.

Because Com-\n merce’s final determination is unsupported by substantial\n evidence and contrary to law, we vacate and remand.\n                 A.

Cost Recovery\n     Commerce’s cost-recovery analysis is limited to a dis-\n cussion of KEPCO’s costs. See J.A. 13081–83. The limited\n analysis does not support its conclusion that electricity\n prices paid to KEPCO by respondents are consistent with\n prevailing market conditions because Commerce failed to\n evaluate KPX’s impact on the Korean electricity market.\n     In Nucor, Plaintiff Nucor argued that Commerce erred\n by limiting the analysis to the prices that KEPCO charged\n in relation to its costs, which included the price paid to\n KPX, instead of considering the adequacy (less-than-ade-\n quate remuneration) of the prices that KPX charged in re-\n lation to its </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">costs..</span> <span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">1255</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

J.A. 13083. To the\n contrary, evidence in the record suggests that KPX has a\n significant impact on KEPCO’s pricing, and that Com-\n merce failed to adequately investigate and consider KPX’s\n impact on the Korean electricity market.

Instead, Commerce determined that only the\n costs to KEPCO, not the costs associated with the genera-\n tors themselves, were relevant to price because KEPCO\n purchases electricity through KPX, which purchases from\n the generators. See J.A. 13083. Commerce’s determina-\n tion that KPX was not relevant to its analysis leaves unre-\n solved whether a benefit was conferred by way of the price\n charged by KPX to KEPCO.

Under\n § 1677(5)(B)(iii), an authority is defined as “a government\n of a country or any public entity within the territory of the\n country.” In Guangdong Wireking Housewares & Hard-\n ware Co. v.

The\n court explained that § 1677(5)(B)’s “public entity” provision\n includes entities that are majority owned by a government\n and it relied on “Commerce’s longstanding practice of treat-\n ing most government-owned corporations as the govern-\n ment itself.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at 1376–77 </span><pre class=\"inline\">(internal quotation marks\n omitted). Here, the Korean government’s questionnaire re-\n sponse clarifies that KPX is a wholly owned subsidiary of\n KEPCO. J.A. 3111. There is no dispute that KEPCO is a\n state-owned entity and the sole provider of electricity in\n Korea. This evidence strongly suggests that KPX, like\n KEPCO, is an authority under § 1677(5)(B).

In October\n 2017, St. Jude Medical, LLC filed two petitions with the\n United States Patent and Trademark Office, under 35\n U.S.C. §§ 311–19, seeking inter partes reviews of claims 1,\n 2, 4–8, 10–13, 17–19, 21, 22, and 25–30 of the ’782 patent\n (the challenged claims) by the Office’s Patent Trial and Ap-\n peal Board. The Board, as delegee of the Director of the\n Office, 37 C.F.R. §§ 42.4, 42.108, instituted two reviews,\n each addressing all the challenged claims.\n     In IPR2018-00105 (IPR-105), the Board ultimately\n ruled that St. Jude had failed to establish unpatentability\n of any of the challenged claims. Specifically, the Board re-\n jected St. Jude’s contention that all the challenged claims\n were anticipated by the Leonhardt patent and would have\n been obvious over Leonhardt plus either the Anderson pa-\n tent or the Johnson and Imachi patents.

In\n IPR2018-00106 (IPR-106), the Board found claims 1, 2, 6,\n and 8 anticipated by the Bessler patent, but it rejected St.\n Jude’s contentions as to all other claims. Specifically, it\n ruled that St. Jude had not proved, as to all but claims 1,\n 2, 6, and 8, anticipation by Bessler or obviousness over\n Bessler combined with either Anderson or Johnson and\n Imachi.

May 2,\n 2019) (IPR-106 Decision).\n     St. Jude appeals on a subset of the challenges it pre-\n sented to the Board. For IPR-105, it argues that the Board\n erroneously rejected the contention that Leonhardt antici-\n pated claims 1, 2, 4–8, and 28, the alleged error being the\n Board’s application of the construction of the claim term\n “band.” For IPR-106, St. Jude argues that the Board erro-\n neously rejected the contention that Bessler anticipated\n claim 28, the alleged error being the Board’s finding a fail-\n ure of proof that Bessler meets claim 28’s “manipulator”\n limitation. St. Jude also argues, for IPR-106, that the\n Board erred in rejecting St. Jude’s challenge to most of the\n claims at issue (all but claims 17, 27, and 30) for obvious-\n ness over Bessler plus Johnson and Imachi. Snyders cross-\n appeals in IPR-106, arguing that the Board committed sev-\n eral errors in finding claims 1, 2, 6, and 8 anticipated by\n Bessler.\n     We affirm the Board’s decision in IPR-105. We reverse\n the Board’s finding in IPR-106 that Bessler anticipated\n claims 1, 2, 6, and 8. We need not reach St. Jude’s antici-\n pation argument as to claim 28, and we affirm the Board’s\n obviousness rejection in IPR-106.\n                                I\n                                A\n     Human hearts have four chambers and four valves that\n regulate blood flow as the heart expands and contracts.\n ’782 patent, col. 1, lines 13–18.

In IPR-106,\n St. Jude argued that the same claims were anticipated by\n Bessler, as well as unpatentable for obviousness over\n Bessler, Johnson, and Imachi.

In the respect relevant on appeal, the Board\n essentially adopted St. Jude’s proposed claim construction\n of “band”: The Board’s construction was “a structure gen-\n erally in the shape of a closed strip or ring,” which slightly\n broadened St. Jude’s language by replacing St. Jude’s “cir-\n cular” with “closed” (thereby including ovals, for example).\n Id. at *5–6.

SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n (and therefore of dependent claims 2 and 4–8) and claim\n 28. If Leonhardt does not disclose a “band,” it does not an-\n ticipate these claims. We affirm the Board’s determination\n that Leonhardt does not disclose a band and therefore af-\n firm the Board’s decision in IPR-105.\n     The Board determined that Leonhardt’s graft mate-\n rial—the component in Leonhardt that St. Jude argued\n was the required “band”—did not meet the band limitation.\n St. Jude challenges that determination on the ground that,\n in making it, the Board failed “to apply its own construc-\n tion, and instead appl[ied] a narrower implicit construc-\n tion” of “band.” St. Jude Opening Br. at 28. We disagree. 4\n     In the respect relevant on appeal, the Board adopted as\n the governing claim construction for “band” the proposal\n that St. Jude itself advanced, except for making one small\n change that broadened, rather than narrowed, St. Jude’s\n proposal. St. Jude proposed that “band” be construed to\n mean “‘[a] structure generally in the shape of a circular\n strip or ring; a band can be integrated with the frame.’”\n IPR-105 Decision at *5. Relying on a district court’s anal-\n ysis in related litigation, the Board rejected the “can be in-\n tegrated with the frame” portion of St. Jude’s proposal, and\n St. Jude does not dispute that conclusion. Id. at *5–6. As\n to the rest, the Board concluded that “circular” was too lim-\n iting, as it might exclude oval shapes, so it substituted\n “closed” to arrive at its construction: “a structure generally\n in the shape of a closed strip or ring.” Id. St. Jude\n\n\n      4  Snyders also argues that—even if Leonhardt’s\n graft material constitutes a band—we should affirm the\n Board’s decision on the alternative grounds that (1) the\n graft material does not limit spacing between peripheral\n anchors and (2) Leonhardt does not disclose a valve ele-\n ment attached to the central portion of the frame. Snyders\n Response Br. at 34–35. We need not and do not reach those\n issues.\n\fCase: 19-2108     Document: 63      Page: 11     Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC           11\n\n\n\n expressly accepts that construction. St. Jude Opening Br.\n at 21 (“St. Jude agrees with this construction—it is entirely\n consistent with the claim language itself and the specifica-\n tion’s description of a band.”).\n     The Board later concluded that the Leonhardt graft\n material does not qualify, because, like a sleeve, it extends\n in width (or “length,” in the patent’s language) over the en-\n tire structure it wraps around. IPR-105 Decision at *8–9.\n In reaching this conclusion, the Board relied on the terms\n “strip” and “ring”—which came from and are accepted by\n St. Jude. Id. (“graft material 24 cannot be considered a\n strip or ring”). St. Jude’s argument is that this conclusion\n changed the claim construction. But the Board in fact ex-\n pressly relied on the now-accepted claim construction.\n     St. Jude’s argument that the Board must have changed\n the construction is meritless. St. Jude argues that no\n width restriction can be part of the ordinary skilled arti-\n san’s understanding of the term “band”—that no matter\n how wide (or “long,” in the patent’s terms) is the material\n making a loop around a structure (here, the frame), it nec-\n essarily counts as a “band.” In support, St. Jude quotes a\n dictionary definition of “band” (“[a] thin strip of flexible ma-\n terial used to encircle or bind one object or to hold a number\n of objects together”) and contends that the specification\n “explicitly disclaims any restriction on the length of a\n band.” St. Jude Opening Br. at 30–31.\n     One problem with these contentions is that they are\n flawed on their own terms. The dictionary definition does\n not exclude any width constraint from being part of the rel-\n evant understanding. Indeed, “thin strip” in the quoted\n definition suggests the possibility of such a constraint, as\n do the words “strip or stripe” and “narrow strip” in the im-\n mediately succeeding definitions in the same dictionary en-\n try for “band.” American Heritage Dictionary of the\n English Language 143 (3d ed. 1992). And the specification\n material cited by St. Jude goes no further than showing\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 12   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12         ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n that the specification does not affirmatively specify any\n particular limit on a band’s width (“length,” in the patent’s\n terms). See ’782 patent, col. 9, lines 24–28 (reciting exam-\n ples of certain “lengths” and adding that a band “may have\n other lengths”). The specification does not “explicitly dis-\n claim[] any restriction on the length of a band.” St. Jude\n Opening Br. at 31.\n      The more fundamental problem with St. Jude’s basis\n for its argument, however, is that it simply does not ad-\n dress the terms “strip” and “ring,” which St. Jude itself pro-\n posed and now accepts as the defining terms of the claim\n construction. The relied-on dictionary definitions and spec-\n ification passages address “band” but not “strip” or “ring.”\n St. Jude has offered nothing at all to indicate that “strip”\n and “ring” cannot have any width (“length,” in the patent’s\n terms) constraint in the relevant skilled artisan’s under-\n standing. If St. Jude wanted to argue that “band” pre-\n cludes any such constraint, it should have proposed a claim\n construction that did so. It did not. The adopted claim con-\n struction therefore governs, and St. Jude has no persuasive\n argument that all width constraints are alien to the key\n terms of that construction, “strip” and “ring.” Nor has St.\n Jude made any argument that, if some width constraint is\n within a skilled artisan’s understanding of “strip” or “ring,”\n the Board lacked substantial evidence to find that the full-\n length sleeve-like covering of Leonhardt does not qualify.\n     We therefore reject St. Jude’s challenge to the decision\n in IPR-105.\n                               B\n     Both parties challenge aspects of the Board’s decision\n in IPR-106. We begin by addressing the challenge pre-\n sented by Snyders, in its cross-appeal, to the Board’s find-\n ing that Bessler anticipated claims 1, 2, 6, and 8. We then\n address St. Jude’s argument that the Board erred in not\n finding claim 28 anticipated. Lastly, we address St. Jude’s\n obviousness challenge.\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 13   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC        13\n\n\n\n                                1\n     In its cross-appeal, Snyders alleges three errors under-\n lying the Board’s finding that Bessler anticipated claim 1\n and dependent claims 2, 6, and 8. It argues that the\n Board’s construction of the claim 1 limitation concerning\n how the frame is “sized and shaped” is incorrect because it\n covers frames sized and shaped for installation with the\n native valve removed, rather than only with the troubled\n native valve remaining in place. Snyders also challenges\n the Board’s construction of claim 1’s “attached” limitation,\n arguing that the limitation must be construed to exclude\n indirect methods of attaching the valve element and the\n frame. Finally, Snyders argues that the Board incorrectly\n found that the cuff in Bessler satisfies the claim 1 require-\n ment that the band “limit[] spacing” between adjacent\n frame anchors.\n     We agree with Snyders that the Board erred in constru-\n ing the “sized and shaped” limitation and that Bessler\n therefore does not anticipate claims 1, 2, 6, and 8. We do\n not reach the other cross-appeal arguments.\n     In finding that Bessler anticipated claims 1, 2, 6, and\n 8, one of the limitations the Board found satisfied by\n Bessler is the claim 1 limitation requiring a “frame sized\n and shaped for insertion between the upstream region and\n the downstream region.” IPR-106 Decision at *8–9. The\n Board determined that “[t]he claim language does not re-\n quire the frame be sized and shaped for insertion into a\n damaged heart valve,” but “only that the frame is sized and\n shaped for insertion in a position between the upstream re-\n gion and the downstream region.” Id. at *9. For that rea-\n son, the Board, without disputing the express assertion by\n Snyders that Bessler requires removal of the native valve\n for installation of the replacement valve, found that\n Bessler’s valve satisfies the limitation. Id.\n     Claim 1 of the ’782 patent recites an “artificial heart\n valve for repairing a damaged heart valve having a\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 14   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14         ST.

The language provides some support for the read-\n ing advanced by Snyders in preference to the Board’s con-\n struction. The requirement that the frame be “sized and\n shaped” a certain way suggests a focus on how the frame is\n fitted to the surrounding material (which depends on\n whether the native valve remains), a focus that goes be-\n yond mere linear “position” between two regions, IPR-106\n Decision at *9. The claim’s reference to “repairing a dam-\n aged heart valve,” without any reference to removal, sug-\n gests that the native valve remains. So too does the claim’s\n reference to the damaged heart valve “having a plurality of\n cusps,” which appears superfluous if claim 1 is interpreted\n to include embodiments where the damaged valve and its\n cusps are removed. See Wasica Fin. GmbH v. Cont’l Auto.\n Sys., Inc., 853 F.3d 1272, 1288 n.10 (Fed.

See ’782 patent, col. 1, lines 37–42 (“[M]any [pre-\n vious] valves also require the damaged native heart valve\n to be removed prior to implanting the artificial valve.”); id.,\n col. 1, lines 40–42 (“Removing the native valve increases\n the risk that a portion of the valve will migrate through the\n body and block vessels downstream from the heart.”); id.,\n col. 2, lines 21–25 (“Among the several objects and features\n of the present invention may be noted the provision of an\n artificial heart valve which accommodates implantation\n without removing the damaged native heart valve . . . .”).\n Of particular note, the specification expressly describes\n Bessler as presenting problems that the Snyders invention\n overcomes, stating that the procedure disclosed in Bessler\n is too invasive because it “includes excision, vacuum re-\n moval of the native valve, cardiopulmonary bypass and\n backflushing of the coronary arterial tree.” Id., col. 2, lines\n 14–20 (emphasis added).\n     The specification passages, including its specific de-\n scription of overcoming deficiencies in Bessler, go beyond\n stating a general preference for leaving the native valve in-\n tact. Those passages make it unreasonable to read the\n “sized and shaped for insertion” claim language as covering\n an artificial valve fitted for the space left after removing\n the native valve.\n     This conclusion precludes anticipation by Bessler on\n the record of IPR-106. Before the Board, in responding to\n the argument by Snyders on this claim limitation, St. Jude\n relied only on its claim-construction argument that the ’782\n claims cover the situation of a removed native valve; it did\n not dispute the express assertion by Snyders that Bessler\n\fCase: 19-2108     Document: 63      Page: 16     Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 16         ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n “‘requires removal of the native heart valve.’” IPR-106 De-\n cision at *9 (quoting Patent Owner’s Response at 17–18);\n J.A. 3289–90 (Reply to Patent Owner’s Response at 3–4). 5\n St. Jude therefore has not preserved any argument that\n Bessler taught a non-removal alternative that satisfied the\n “sized and shaped” limitation. See Novartis AG v. Torrent\n Pharms. Ltd., 853 F.3d 1316, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2017); In re\n Baxter Int’l, Inc., 678 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2012).\n     Because we reject St. Jude’s (and the Board’s) claim\n construction, we conclude that Bessler does not meet this\n limitation and therefore cannot anticipate claims 1, 2, 6,\n and 8. See Biscotti, 878 F.3d at 1069 (“[A] prior art refer-\n ence must provide every element of the claimed invention\n arranged as in the claim in order to anticipate.”). Accord-\n ingly, we hold that claims 1, 2, 6, and 8 are not anticipated\n by Bessler, and we reverse the Board’s contrary determi-\n nation.\n                                2\n     St. Jude’s first contention in its appeal in IPR-106 is\n that the Board committed substantive and procedural er-\n rors when it found claim 28 not anticipated by Bessler be-\n cause St. Jude did not prove that Bessler discloses the\n “manipulator” required by claim 28. We need not and do\n not reach this challenge. Claim 28 contains exactly the\n same “sized and shaped” limitation for the valve as does\n claim 1, requiring a valve meeting that limitation (among\n others) in combination with an instrument used to install\n the valve. ’782 patent, col. 13, line 66, through col. 14, line\n\n\n\n      5   In its briefing in this court, St. Jude appears to sug-\n gest at one place that, before the Board, it responded to the\n “sized and shaped” contention of Snyders by arguing that\n Bessler does not require native-valve removal. See St. Jude\n Response & Reply Br. at 40–41. Its citations to the record\n do not support the suggestion.\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 17    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC          17\n\n\n\n 56. Because we hold that Snyders is correct that Bessler\n does not meet the “sized and shaped” limitation, Bessler\n cannot anticipate claim 28 regardless of whether it meets\n the additional requirement of a “manipulator” component\n relating to the insertion instrument.\n                                3\n     St. Jude’s second contention in its appeal in IPR-106\n challenges the Board’s conclusion that St. Jude failed to\n prove that claims 1, 2, 4–8, 10–13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28,\n and 29 of the ’782 patent would have been obvious over\n Bessler, Johnson, and Imachi. We reject this challenge.\n     The Board agreed with St. Jude that a relevant skilled\n artisan would have been motivated to combine Bessler and\n Johnson, given that Johnson disclosed a more durable\n valve than Bessler’s valve, while Bessler disclosed a stent\n that could be installed via catheter (not open-heart sur-\n gery). IPR-106 Decision at *18. But the Board found that\n St. Jude failed to prove that a relevant artisan would have\n made the particular combination St. Jude proposed—re-\n taining the “cuff” from Bessler (but not its valve) to provide\n the “band” required by the claims at issue. Id. at *19. 6 The\n Board found that Bessler’s cuff is “an integral portion of the\n valve member” and that its purpose is “attaching the valve\n to the stent.” Id. It therefore concluded that St. Jude had\n not shown why a relevant artisan “when replacing\n Bessler’s valve with Johnson’s valve would remove the leaf-\n let portion of B[e]ssler’s valve but retain the cuff portion.”\n Id.\n\n\n\n\n     6    Before the Board, St. Jude proposed an alternative\n combination that would use a feature of Johnson (not the\n cuff of Bessler) as the claim-required band, but the Board\n rejected that alternative, IPR-106 Decision at *19, and St.\n Jude does not challenge that rejection on appeal.\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 18   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18         ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n     The Board’s determination on this point—whether a\n skilled artisan would be motivated to make the proposed\n combination to arrive at the claimed invention—is a fac-\n tual one that we review for substantial-evidence support.\n See Arctic Cat Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Prods. Inc.,\n 876 F.3d 1350, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2017). It was St. Jude’s bur-\n den to support its assertion by a preponderance of the evi-\n dence. See 35 U.S.C. § 316(e); In re Magnum Oil Tools Int’l,\n Ltd., 829 F.3d 1364, 1376–77 (Fed. Cir. 2016). We conclude\n that the Board did not lack substantial-evidence support in\n finding a failure of proof by St. Jude.\n     As the Board noted, Bessler describes its cuff as ex-\n tending from the periphery of the circular and leaflet por-\n tions of its valve, and attaching to the stent to hold the\n valve and stent together. ’601 patent, col. 5, lines 15–25,\n 38–42. In St. Jude’s proposed combination of Johnson and\n Bessler, however, the leaflet portion of Bessler’s valve\n would be removed in favor of Johnson’s valve, while retain-\n ing the cuff portion of Bessler’s valve. Pet. for Inter Partes\n Review at 68, J.A. 2946. The Board explained, however,\n that “the cuff is an integral portion of the valve member,”\n that “the purpose of the cuff portion [is] for attaching the\n valve to the stent,” and that, “[o]nce the leaflet portion of\n Bessler’s valve is removed, the cuff serves no purpose.”\n IPR-106 Decision at *19. The Board found no “adequate[]”\n or “persua[sive]” explanation by St. Jude for why a relevant\n artisan would keep the “integral” cuff portion while replac-\n ing the leaflet portion to which it is attached. Id.\n      The relevant portion of St. Jude’s petition offers no\n meaningful explanation for this proposal. Pet. for Inter\n Partes Review at 55–56, J.A. 2933–34. The relevant por-\n tion of the petition cites five paragraphs from the declara-\n tion of St. Jude’s expert, Dr. Lakshmi Prasad Dasi, id.\n (citing Dasi Declaration ¶¶ 66–70, J.A. 3677–79), but those\n paragraphs merely characterize Bessler, without address-\n ing the specific question of separating the leaflets from the\n cuff for purposes of a combination with Johnson. St. Jude\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63        Page: 19   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC          19\n\n\n\n now points to two additional paragraphs of the Dasi decla-\n ration, J.A. 3696–98 (¶¶ 109, 111)—which themselves de-\n scribe how the contemplated combination would function,\n rather than specifically address the question of motivation\n to make the specific combination—but those paragraphs\n are not cited in the relevant portion of the petition or in any\n other submission to the Board on this point that St. Jude\n identifies. St. Jude has not demonstrated the unreasona-\n bleness of the Board’s determination that St. Jude did not\n adequately or persuasively establish the motivation to\n make the particular combination it proposed in arguing ob-\n viousness. We therefore affirm the Board’s obviousness de-\n termination in IPR-106. 7\n                               III\n    The Board’s decision in IPR-105 is affirmed. The\n Board’s decision in IPR-106 is reversed as to claims 1, 2, 6,\n and 8 but otherwise affirmed.\n     Costs awarded to Snyders.\n         AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART\n\n\n\n\n     7   As an alternative ground for affirming the Board’s\n obviousness finding, Snyders challenges the Board’s deter-\n mination that a relevant artisan would be motivated to\n combine Bessler, Johnson, and Imachi. Snyders Response\n Br. at 45. We need not reach that argument.\n\f",

For IPR-105, it argues that the Board\n erroneously rejected the contention that Leonhardt antici-\n pated claims 1, 2, 4–8, and 28, the alleged error being the\n Board’s application of the construction of the claim term\n “band.” For IPR-106, St. Jude argues that the Board erro-\n neously rejected the contention that Bessler anticipated\n claim 28, the alleged error being the Board’s finding a fail-\n ure of proof that Bessler meets claim 28’s “manipulator”\n limitation. St. Jude also argues, for IPR-106, that the\n Board erred in rejecting St. Jude’s challenge to most of the\n claims at issue (all but claims 17, 27, and 30) for obvious-\n ness over Bessler plus Johnson and Imachi.

SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n (and therefore of dependent claims 2 and 4–8) and claim\n 28. If Leonhardt does not disclose a “band,” it does not an-\n ticipate these claims. We affirm the Board’s determination\n that Leonhardt does not disclose a band and therefore af-\n firm the Board’s decision in IPR-105.\n     The Board determined that Leonhardt’s graft mate-\n rial—the component in Leonhardt that St. Jude argued\n was the required “band”—did not meet the band limitation.\n St. Jude challenges that determination on the ground that,\n in making it, the Board failed “to apply its own construc-\n tion, and instead appl[ied] a narrower implicit construc-\n tion” of “band.” St. Jude Opening Br. at 28. We disagree. 4\n     In the respect relevant on appeal, the Board adopted as\n the governing claim construction for “band” the proposal\n that St. Jude itself advanced, except for making one small\n change that broadened, rather than narrowed, St. Jude’s\n proposal. St. Jude proposed that “band” be construed to\n mean “‘[a] structure generally in the shape of a circular\n strip or ring; a band can be integrated with the frame.’”\n IPR-105 Decision at *5.

SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC           11\n\n\n\n expressly accepts that construction. St. Jude Opening Br.\n at 21 (“St. Jude agrees with this construction—it is entirely\n consistent with the claim language itself and the specifica-\n tion’s description of a band.”).\n     The Board later concluded that the Leonhardt graft\n material does not qualify, because, like a sleeve, it extends\n in width (or “length,” in the patent’s language) over the en-\n tire structure it wraps around. IPR-105 Decision at *8–9.\n In reaching this conclusion, the Board relied on the terms\n “strip” and “ring”—which came from and are accepted by\n St. Jude.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> (“graft material 24 </span><pre class=\"inline\">cannot be considered a\n strip or ring”). St. Jude’s argument is that this conclusion\n changed the claim construction. But the Board in fact ex-\n pressly relied on the now-accepted claim construction.\n     St. Jude’s argument that the Board must have changed\n the construction is meritless. St. Jude argues that no\n width restriction can be part of the ordinary skilled arti-\n san’s understanding of the term “band”—that no matter\n how wide (or “long,” in the patent’s terms) is the material\n making a loop around a structure (here, the frame), it nec-\n essarily counts as a “band.” In support, St. Jude quotes a\n dictionary definition of “band” (“[a] thin strip of flexible ma-\n terial used to encircle or bind one object or to hold a number\n of objects together”) and contends that the specification\n “explicitly disclaims any restriction on the length of a\n band.” St. Jude Opening Br. at 30–31.\n     One problem with these contentions is that they are\n flawed on their own terms. The dictionary definition does\n not exclude any width constraint from being part of the rel-\n evant understanding. Indeed, “thin strip” in the quoted\n definition suggests the possibility of such a constraint, as\n do the words “strip or stripe” and “narrow strip” in the im-\n mediately succeeding definitions in the same dictionary en-\n try for “band.” American Heritage Dictionary of the\n English Language 143 (3d ed. 1992). And the specification\n material cited by St. Jude goes no further than showing\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 12   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 12         ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n that the specification does not affirmatively specify any\n particular limit on a band’s width (“length,” in the patent’s\n terms). See ’782 patent, col. 9, lines 24–28 (reciting exam-\n ples of certain “lengths” and adding that a band “may have\n other lengths”). The specification does not “explicitly dis-\n claim[] any restriction on the length of a band.” St. Jude\n Opening Br. at 31.\n      The more fundamental problem with St. Jude’s basis\n for its argument, however, is that it simply does not ad-\n dress the terms “strip” and “ring,” which St. Jude itself pro-\n posed and now accepts as the defining terms of the claim\n construction. The relied-on dictionary definitions and spec-\n ification passages address “band” but not “strip” or “ring.”\n St. Jude has offered nothing at all to indicate that “strip”\n and “ring” cannot have any width (“length,” in the patent’s\n terms) constraint in the relevant skilled artisan’s under-\n standing. If St. Jude wanted to argue that “band” pre-\n cludes any such constraint, it should have proposed a claim\n construction that did so. It did not. The adopted claim con-\n struction therefore governs, and St. Jude has no persuasive\n argument that all width constraints are alien to the key\n terms of that construction, “strip” and “ring.” Nor has St.\n Jude made any argument that, if some width constraint is\n within a skilled artisan’s understanding of “strip” or “ring,”\n the Board lacked substantial evidence to find that the full-\n length sleeve-like covering of Leonhardt does not qualify.\n     We therefore reject St. Jude’s challenge to the decision\n in IPR-105.\n                               B\n     Both parties challenge aspects of the Board’s decision\n in IPR-106. We begin by addressing the challenge pre-\n sented by Snyders, in its cross-appeal, to the Board’s find-\n ing that Bessler anticipated claims 1, 2, 6, and 8. We then\n address St. Jude’s argument that the Board erred in not\n finding claim 28 anticipated. Lastly, we address St. Jude’s\n obviousness challenge.\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 13   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v.

It argues that the\n Board’s construction of the claim 1 limitation concerning\n how the frame is “sized and shaped” is incorrect because it\n covers frames sized and shaped for installation with the\n native valve removed, rather than only with the troubled\n native valve remaining in place. Snyders also challenges\n the Board’s construction of claim 1’s “attached” limitation,\n arguing that the limitation must be construed to exclude\n indirect methods of attaching the valve element and the\n frame. Finally, Snyders argues that the Board incorrectly\n found that the cuff in Bessler satisfies the claim 1 require-\n ment that the band “limit[] spacing” between adjacent\n frame anchors.\n     We agree with Snyders that the Board erred in constru-\n ing the “sized and shaped” limitation and that Bessler\n therefore does not anticipate claims 1, 2, 6, and 8. We do\n not reach the other cross-appeal arguments.\n     In finding that Bessler anticipated claims 1, 2, 6, and\n 8, one of the limitations the Board found satisfied by\n Bessler is the claim 1 limitation requiring a “frame sized\n and shaped for insertion between the upstream region and\n the downstream region.” IPR-106 Decision at *8–9. The\n Board determined that “[t]he claim language does not re-\n quire the frame be sized and shaped for insertion into a\n damaged heart valve,” but “only that the frame is sized and\n shaped for insertion in a position between the upstream re-\n gion and the downstream region.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at *9. </span><pre class=\"inline\">For that rea-\n son, the Board, without disputing the express assertion by\n Snyders that Bessler requires removal of the native valve\n for installation of the replacement valve, found that\n Bessler’s valve satisfies the limitation.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n     Claim 1 of </span><pre class=\"inline\">the ’782 patent recites an “artificial heart\n valve for repairing a damaged heart valve having a\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 14   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 14         ST.

The language provides some support for the read-\n ing advanced by Snyders in preference to the Board’s con-\n struction. The requirement that the frame be “sized and\n shaped” a certain way suggests a focus on how the frame is\n fitted to the surrounding material (which depends on\n whether the native valve remains), a focus that goes be-\n yond mere linear “position” between two regions, IPR-106\n Decision at *9. The claim’s reference to “repairing a dam-\n aged heart valve,” without any reference to removal, sug-\n gests that the native valve remains. So too does the claim’s\n reference to the damaged heart valve “having a plurality of\n cusps,” which appears superfluous if claim 1 is interpreted\n to include embodiments where the damaged valve and its\n cusps are removed.

Accord-\n ingly, we hold that claims 1, 2, 6, and 8 are not anticipated\n by Bessler, and we reverse the Board’s contrary determi-\n nation.\n                                2\n     St. Jude’s first contention in its appeal in IPR-106 is\n that the Board committed substantive and procedural er-\n rors when it found claim 28 not anticipated by Bessler be-\n cause St. Jude did not prove that Bessler discloses the\n “manipulator” required by claim 28. We need not and do\n not reach this challenge. Claim 28 contains exactly the\n same “sized and shaped” limitation for the valve as does\n claim 1, requiring a valve meeting that limitation (among\n others) in combination with an instrument used to install\n the valve. ’782 patent, col. 13, line 66, through col. 14, line\n\n\n\n      5   In its briefing in this court, St. Jude appears to sug-\n gest at one place that, before the Board, it responded to the\n “sized and shaped” contention of Snyders by arguing that\n Bessler does not require native-valve removal. See St. Jude\n Response & Reply Br. at 40–41. Its citations to the record\n do not support the suggestion.\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 17    Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC          17\n\n\n\n 56. Because we hold that Snyders is correct that Bessler\n does not meet the “sized and shaped” limitation, Bessler\n cannot anticipate claim 28 regardless of whether it meets\n the additional requirement of a “manipulator” component\n relating to the insertion instrument.\n                                3\n     St. Jude’s second contention in its appeal in IPR-106\n challenges the Board’s conclusion that St. Jude failed to\n prove that claims 1, 2, 4–8, 10–13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28,\n and 29 of the ’782 patent would have been obvious over\n Bessler, Johnson, and Imachi. We reject this challenge.\n     The Board agreed with St. Jude that a relevant skilled\n artisan would have been motivated to combine Bessler and\n Johnson, given that Johnson disclosed a more durable\n valve than Bessler’s valve, while Bessler disclosed a stent\n that could be installed via catheter (not open-heart sur-\n gery). IPR-106 Decision at *18. But the Board found that\n St. Jude failed to prove that a relevant artisan would have\n made the particular combination St. Jude proposed—re-\n taining the “cuff” from Bessler (but not its valve) to provide\n the “band” required by the claims at issue.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> at *19. 6 </span><pre class=\"inline\">The\n Board found that Bessler’s cuff is “an integral portion of the\n valve member” and that its purpose is “attaching the valve\n to the stent.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span> It therefore concluded </span><pre class=\"inline\">that St. Jude had\n not shown why a relevant artisan “when replacing\n Bessler’s valve with Johnson’s valve would remove the leaf-\n let portion of B[e]ssler’s valve but retain the cuff portion.”</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">\n <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n\n\n\n\n     6 </span><pre class=\"inline\">   Before the Board, St. Jude proposed an alternative\n combination that would use a feature of Johnson (not the\n cuff of Bessler) as the claim-required band, but the Board\n rejected that alternative, IPR-106 Decision at *19, and St.\n Jude does not challenge that rejection on appeal.\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63       Page: 18   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n 18         ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC\n\n\n\n     The Board’s determination on this point—whether a\n skilled artisan would be motivated to make the proposed\n combination to arrive at the claimed invention—is a fac-\n tual one that we review for substantial-evidence support.\n See Arctic Cat Inc. v. Bombardier Recreational Prods. Inc.,\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2017). It was St. Jude’s bur-\n den to support its assertion by a preponderance of the evi-\n dence. See 35 U.S.C. § 316(e); In re Magnum Oil Tools Int’l,\n Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1376–77 (Fed. Cir. 2016). We conclude\n that the Board did not lack substantial-evidence support in\n finding a failure of proof by St. Jude.\n     As the Board noted, Bessler describes its cuff as ex-\n tending from the periphery of the circular and leaflet por-\n tions of its valve, and attaching to the stent to hold the\n valve and stent together. ’601 patent, col. 5, lines 15–25,\n 38–42. In St. Jude’s proposed combination of Johnson and\n Bessler, however, the leaflet portion of Bessler’s valve\n would be removed in favor of Johnson’s valve, while retain-\n ing the cuff portion of Bessler’s valve. Pet. for Inter Partes\n Review at 68, J.A. 2946. The Board explained, however,\n that “the cuff is an integral portion of the valve member,”\n that “the purpose of the cuff portion [is] for attaching the\n valve to the stent,” and that, “[o]nce the leaflet portion of\n Bessler’s valve is removed, the cuff serves no purpose.”\n IPR-106 Decision at *19. The Board found no “adequate[]”\n or “persua[sive]” explanation by St. Jude for why a relevant\n artisan would keep the “integral” cuff portion while replac-\n ing the leaflet portion to which it is attached.</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"> <span class=\"id_token\">Id.</span>\n      The relevant portion </span><pre class=\"inline\">of St. Jude’s petition offers no\n meaningful explanation for this proposal. Pet. for Inter\n Partes Review at 55–56, J.A. 2933–34. The relevant por-\n tion of the petition cites five paragraphs from the declara-\n tion of St. Jude’s expert, Dr. Lakshmi Prasad Dasi</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">, <span class=\"id_token\">id.</span>\n (citing Dasi Declaration </span><pre class=\"inline\">¶¶ 66–70, J.A. 3677–79), but those\n paragraphs merely characterize Bessler, without address-\n ing the specific question of separating the leaflets from the\n cuff for purposes of a combination with Johnson. St. Jude\n\fCase: 19-2108    Document: 63        Page: 19   Filed: 10/15/2020\n\n\n\n\n ST. JUDE MEDICAL, LLC   v. SNYDERS HEART VALVE LLC          19\n\n\n\n now points to two additional paragraphs of the Dasi decla-\n ration, J.A. 3696–98 (¶¶ 109, 111)—which themselves de-\n scribe how the contemplated combination would function,\n rather than specifically address the question of motivation\n to make the specific combination—but those paragraphs\n are not cited in the relevant portion of the petition or in any\n other submission to the Board on this point that St. Jude\n identifies. St. Jude has not demonstrated the unreasona-\n bleness of the Board’s determination that St. Jude did not\n adequately or persuasively establish the motivation to\n make the particular combination it proposed in arguing ob-\n viousness. We therefore affirm the Board’s obviousness de-\n termination in IPR-106. 7\n                               III\n    The Board’s decision in IPR-105 is affirmed. The\n Board’s decision in IPR-106 is reversed as to claims 1, 2, 6,\n and 8 but otherwise affirmed.\n     Costs awarded to Snyders.\n         AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART\n\n\n\n\n     7   As an alternative ground for affirming the Board’s\n obviousness finding, Snyders challenges the Board’s deter-\n mination that a relevant artisan would be motivated to\n combine Bessler, Johnson, and Imachi. Snyders Response\n Br. at 45. We need not reach that argument.\n\f</pre>",
